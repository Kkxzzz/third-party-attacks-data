While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others. Two proximate causes were the rise in subprime lending and the increase in housing speculation. The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S. A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, had an interest rate that increased over time."

                "answer": "The subprime mortgage crisis in the United States occurred between 2007 and 2010 and contributed to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. It led to a severe economic recession, with millions of job losses and business bankruptcies. The crisis was triggered by a decline in US home prices after a housing bubble collapse, resulting in mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities. The crisis was caused by various factors, including subprime lending and housing speculation. The US government intervened with measures such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to stabilize the financial system."

The movement secured new protections for the civil rights of all Americans through nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns. The Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to African Americans after the American Civil War, but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights under Jim Crow laws and subjected to discrimination and violence. The civil rights movement included boycotts, sit-ins, protests, and marches, and it led to landmark Supreme Court rulings against racist discrimination."

Washington has thus been called the \"Father of his Country\".\nWashington's first public office, from 1749 to 1750, was as surveyor of Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia. He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States. He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\nWashington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously."

Vaccines go through multiple phases of trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. \nMany vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time. For example, tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years. Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions. Over the past two decades, the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed.Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas (countries, sub national areas, or at-risk populations) where a disease is common. For instance, yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease. In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage. Sample vaccination schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child's life and uses vaccines which cost over $700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $25."

The schedule may include multiple doses for maximum effectiveness. The recommended vaccination schedule has become more complicated over the years due to the development of new vaccines. The response does not provide specific information about when the mumpsvax vaccine was administered in 1960."

He co-invented the first successful  open-circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, (\"SCUBA\"), called the Aqua-Lung, which assisted him in producing some of the first underwater documentaries.\nCousteau wrote many books describing his undersea explorations. In his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure, Cousteau surmised the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. The book was adapted into an underwater documentary called The Silent World. Co-directed by Cousteau and Louis Malle, it was one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to document the ocean depths in color. The film won the 1956 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and remained the only documentary to do so until 2004 (when Fahrenheit 9/11 received the award). It was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957.\nFrom 1966 to 1976, he hosted The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, a documentary television series, presented on American commercial television stations. A second documentary series, The Cousteau Odyssey, ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations."
