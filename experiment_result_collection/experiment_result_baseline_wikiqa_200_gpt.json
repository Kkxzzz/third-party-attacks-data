Also, TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further. Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes, station directories such as TuneIn, show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher, and time-shifting services like DAR.fm."

                "answer": "Talk radio began in the U.S. as a radio format that focuses on discussions about topical issues. It consists mainly of original spoken word content and may include monologues, dialogues between hosts, interviews with guests, and listener participation. Talk radio shows on commercial stations are organized into segments separated by advertisements, while non-commercial stations may play music instead. Variations of talk radio include conservative talk, hot talk, liberal talk (also known as progressive talk), and sports talk. In recent years, the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows has become more accessible, allowing individuals to host their own shows without the need for a traditional radio station. Additionally, TV programming from talk and news outlets is now often available, expanding the reach of talk radio. Talk radio can be enjoyed on various devices and services, including radios, PCs, smartphones, and streaming platforms."

Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and recorded on 17 October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment.\nWith advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group's first million-seller \"She Loves You\", their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top 50 for 21 weeks in total.It was also the group's first American number-one hit, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number 45 and starting the British Invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February it topped the Hot 100, and stayed there for seven weeks before being replaced by \"She Loves You\". It remained on the Billboard chart for 15 weeks. \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide, selling more than 12 million copies. In 2018, Billboard magazine named it the 48th biggest hit of all time on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, it was the second-highest-selling single of the 1960s, behind \"She Loves You\"."

The power ballad was written by Diane Warren, who originally envisioned it would be performed by \"Celine Dion or somebody like that\". The song received its airplay premiere on May 12, 1998, and was officially added to radio a week later.\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" was first released in Japan on July 29, 1998. In the United States, it was originally supposed to be a radio-only single from Armageddon: The Album, but due to popular demand, Columbia Records issued the song commercially in August 1998. It subsequently debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving the band their first and only number-one single in their home country. The song also peaked at number one for multiple weeks in several other countries, including Australia, Ireland, and Norway. In the United Kingdom, it sold over one million copies and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was covered by American country music singer Mark Chesnutt for his album of the same name."

Benedict's election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Benedict chose to be known as \\\"Pope emeritus\\\" upon his resignation, and he retained this title until his death in December 2022.Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age of 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Before becoming pope, he had been \\\"a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century\\\"; he had had an influence \\\"second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions\\\" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.Benedict's writings were prolific and generally defended traditional Catholic doctrine, values, and liturgy. He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries.

XVI; Italian: Benedetto XVI; German: Benedikt XVI; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger; 16 April 1927 \u2013 31 December 2022) was the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 19 April 2005 until his resignation on 28 February 2013. Benedict's election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Benedict chose to be known as \"Pope emeritus\" upon his resignation, and he retained this title until his death in December 2022.Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age of 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Before becoming pope, he had been \"a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century\"; he had had an influence \"second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions\" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.Benedict's writings were prolific and generally defended traditional Catholic doctrine, values, and liturgy. He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He viewed relativism's denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century."

The Hebrew day starts and ends at sunset, so the holiday starts at sunset the day before. For example, in 2023, 15 Nisan coincides with Thursday April 6. Therefore, Pesach starts at sundown Wednesday April 5. The word Pesach or Passover can also refer to the Korban Pesach, the paschal lamb that was offered when the Temple in Jerusalem stood; to the Passover Seder, the ritual meal on Passover night; or to the Feast of Unleavened Bread. One of the biblically ordained Three Pilgrimage Festivals, Passover is celebrated for seven days in Israel and for eight days among the Jewish diaspora, based on the concept of yom tov sheni shel galuyot. In the Bible, the seven-day holiday is known as Chag HaMatzot, the feast of unleavened bread (matzah).According to the Book of Exodus, God (Yahweh) commanded Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors in order that the Angel of Death would pass over them (i.e., that they would not be touched by the tenth plague, death of the firstborn). After the death of the firstborn, Pharaoh ordered the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asked Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord.\"}}}",

Those forces were led by former royalist commander Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, who united with insurgent leader Vicente Guerrero under the 1821 Plan of Iguala.\nMexican independence from Spain was not an inevitable outcome of the relationship between the Spanish Empire and its most valuable overseas possession, but events in Spain had a direct impact on the outbreak of the armed insurgency in 1810 and the course of warfare through the end of the conflict. Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Spain in 1808 touched off a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule, since he had placed his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne after forcing the abdication of the Spanish monarch Charles IV. In Spain and many of its overseas possessions, the local response was to set up juntas, ruling in the name of the Bourbon monarchy. Delegates in Spain and overseas territories met in C\u00e1diz \u2014 a small corner of the Iberian Peninsula still under Spanish control \u2014 as the Cortes of C\u00e1diz, and drafted the Spanish Constitution of 1812. That constitution sought to create a new governing framework in the absence of the legitimate Spanish monarch. It tried to accommodate the aspirations of American-born Spaniards (criollos) for more local control and equal standing with Peninsular-born Spaniards, known locally as peninsulares. This political process had far-reaching impacts in New Spain during the independence war and beyond."

The Mexican War of Independence, which took place from 1810 to 1821, resulted in Mexico's independence from the Spanish Empire. The conflict was a series of local and regional struggles that culminated in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 28, 1821. The forces for independence were led by Agust\u00edn de Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero under the 1821 Plan of Iguala.

Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed-air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side-on vehicle impact.The first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s, with limited success, and actually caused some fatalities."

                "answer": "The airbag is a vehicle occupant-restraint system that inflates quickly during a collision to provide cushioning and restraint for the occupants. It reduces injuries between the occupants and the interior of the vehicle. The airbag is triggered by crash sensors that provide information about the type, angle, and severity of the impact. The airbag modules are deployed through a pyrotechnic process and newer designs use compressed-air cylinders for side-impact collisions. The first commercial airbag designs were introduced in the 1970s."

The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in either the late winter or spring (\\\"spring forward\\\"), and to set clocks back by one hour in the fall (North American English) (\\\"fall back\\\") or autumn (UK English) to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in early spring and one 25-hour day in the middle of autumn.\\nThe idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in 1784 by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage; and calculated considerable savings. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the idea of changing clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society. In 1907, British resident William Willett presented the idea as a way to save energy. After some serious consideration, it was not implemented.In 1908, Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada (today merged into Thunder Bay), started using DST. Starting on 30 April 1916, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary each organized the first nationwide implementation in their jurisdictions. Many countries have used DST at various times since then, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis.

The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in either the late winter or spring (\"spring forward\"), and to set clocks back by one hour in the fall (North American English) (\"fall back\") or autumn (UK English) to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in early spring and one 25-hour day in the middle of autumn.\nThe idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in 1784 by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage; and calculated considerable savings. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the idea of changing clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society. In 1907, British resident William Willett presented the idea as a way to save energy. After some serious consideration, it was not implemented.In 1908, Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada (today merged into Thunder Bay), started using DST. Starting on 30 April 1916, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary each organized the first nationwide implementation in their jurisdictions. Many countries have used DST at various times since then, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis. DST is generally not observed near the Equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it."

It emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas.\nThe conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and murders carried out in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri by proslavery \"border ruffians\" and retaliatory raids carried out by antislavery \"free-staters\". According to Kansapedia of the Kansas Historical Society, 56 political killings were documented during the period, and the total may be as high as 200. It has been called a Tragic Prelude, or an overture, to the American Civil War, which immediately followed it.\nThe conflict centered on the question of whether Kansas, upon gaining statehood, would join the Union as a slave state or a free state. The question was of national importance because Kansas's two new senators would affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which was bitterly divided over the issue of slavery. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 called for popular sovereignty: the decision about slavery would be made by popular vote of the territory's settlers rather than by legislators in Washington. Existing sectional tensions surrounding slavery quickly found focus in Kansas.Missouri, a slave state since 1821, was populated by many settlers with Southern sympathies and proslavery views, some of whom tried to influence the Kansas decision by entering Kansas and claiming to be residents. The conflict was fought politically, and between civilians, where it eventually degenerated into brutal gang violence and paramilitary guerrilla warfare."

For instance, yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease. In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage. Sample vaccination schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child's life and uses vaccines which cost over $700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $25.\"}}}",
        "original_answer": "The response from the API states that a vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations recommended or compulsory depending on the country of residence. Vaccines are used to produce active immunity to a disease and go through multiple phases of trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness. The recommended vaccination schedule has become more complicated over the years due to the development of new vaccines. The response does not specifically mention the administration of Mumpsvax in 1960.",
