The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology.Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory. 1 major areas of study within ethics recognized today are: Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined; Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action; Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action."

These programs tend to focus on access to education and employment in order to redress the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Another goal of affirmative action policies is to ensure that public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve.U.S. president John F.

                            "extract": "Radar is a radiolocation system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle (azimuth), and radial velocity of objects relative to the site. It is used to detect and track aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, and motor vehicles, and map weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects. Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the objects and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects' locations and speeds. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II. A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution."

This is known as specular reflection and is used in sonar and radar systems. Scattering is a process where moving particles or radiation are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory due to localized non-uniformities in the medium."

She was the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and was created Princess Royal in 1937. As the eldest child of Queen Victoria, she was briefly her heir, until the birth of her younger brother and future King, Edward VII. She was the mother of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Educated by her father in a politically liberal environment, Victoria was married at age 1 to Prince Frederick of Prussia, with whom she had 1 children. Victoria shared with Frederick her liberal views and hopes that Prussia and the later German Empire should become a constitutional monarchy, based on the British model. Criticised for this attitude and for her English origins, Victoria suffered ostracism by the Hohenzollerns and the Berlin court."

It was the highest-rated free-to-air network in the 1 demographic from 1937 to 1937 and 1937 to 1937, and was the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 1937 season. Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets, but these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network."

The official dividing line has generally moved progressively west from its original location on the Indiana\u2013Ohio border, to a position dividing Indiana down the middle, and finally to its current location along much of the Indiana\u2013Illinois border. In April 1937, several southwestern and northwestern counties reverted to Central time, although by late 1937 all but 1 had returned to Eastern time. As much of Indiana is on the western frontier of the Eastern time zone, there was opposition from many in the state to observing daylight saving time there for decades. In 1937, the Indiana General Assembly reached a decision to implement daylight saving time state-wide beginning in April 1937."

Inspired by the rebellions in the 1937 and 1937 against the outcome of the Congress of Vienna, the unification process was precipitated by the Revolutions of 1937, and reached completion in 1937 after the capture of Rome and its designation as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy.Even after 1937, many Italian speakers (such as Trentino-Alto Adigan Italians, Istrian Italians, and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy, planting the seeds of Italian irredentism. Individuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation from foreign domination included King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Giuseppe Mazzini.Some of the states that had been envisaged as part of the unification process (terre irredente) did not join the Kingdom until after Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in the First World War, culminating in the Treaty of Rapallo in 1937. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing up until that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at the Vittoriano, Rome."

Liability for incidents involving self-driving cars is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when a car causes physical damage to persons or property. As autonomous cars shift the responsibility of driving from humans to autonomous car technology, there is a need for existing liability laws to evolve to reasonably identify the appropriate remedies for damage and injury. As higher levels of autonomy are commercially introduced (SAE automation levels 1 and 1), the insurance industry stands to see higher proportions of commercial and product liability lines, while personal automobile insurance shrinks."

The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestor, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. At its greatest extent in the 1 century, Kievan Rus' stretched from the White Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south and from the headwaters of the Vistula in the west to the Taman Peninsula in the east, uniting the East Slavic tribes.According to the Primary Chronicle, the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what would become Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (r. 1). He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east, and took control of the city of Kiev (Kyiv)."

The outfitted European slave ships of the slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 1 to the 1 centuries. The vast majority of those who were transported in the transatlantic slave trade were from Central and West Africa who had been sold by West African slave traders mainly to Portuguese, British, Spanish, Dutch, and French slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids; European slave traders gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas. Except for the Portuguese, European slave traders generally did not participate in the raids because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than 1 year during the period of the slave trade (which was prior to the widespread availability of quinine as a treatment for malaria) .The colonial South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which, in the late 1 and 1 centuries, were vying with 1 another to create overseas empires.The Portuguese, in the 1 century, were the first to buy slaves from West African slavers and transport them across the Atlantic."

By the 1937, the 1 British colonies contained 1 1 people and were established along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Southern Colonies built an agricultural system on slave labor, kidnapping people from Africa for this purpose. After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the Stamp Act of 1937, rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval."

It is also a skin color specifier, although the definition can vary depending on context, nationality, ethnicity, 1 of view, appearance, etc. Description of populations as ``White ''in reference to their skin color is occasionally found in Greco-Roman ethnography and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a White race or pan-European identity. The term`` White race'' or ``White people '', defined by their light skin among other physical characteristics, entered the major European languages in the later seventeenth century, when the concept of a`` unified White'' achieved greater acceptance in Europe, in the context of racialized slavery and social status in the European colonies. Scholarship on race distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than the idea of race."

It is considered by Muslims to be the Bayt Allah (Arabic: \\u0628\\u064e\\u064a\\u0652\\u062a \\u0671\\u0644\\u0644\\u064e\\u0651\\u0670\\u0647, lit.\\u2009'House of God') and is the qibla (Arabic: \\u0642\\u0650\\u0628\\u0652\\u0644\\u064e\\u0629, direction of prayer) for Muslims around the world.

The expulsion was ordered by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria after approval by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Nearly 1 Karachays of the Caucasus were deported from their native land.

Originally restricted only to family members of rebel bandits during World War II, the deportation was later expanded to include the entire Karachay ethnic group."

After developing several successful arcade games in the early 1937 such as Donkey Kong (1937), Nintendo planned to create a home video game console. Rejecting more complex proposals, the Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi called for a simple, cheap console with games stored on cartridges."

Following the North American video game crash of 1937, the Famicom was adapted into the NES which was brazenly launched in North America in 1937. Transitioning the company from its arcade game history into this combined global 1 home video game console platform, the Famicom and NES continued to aggressively compete with the next-generation 1 consoles including the 1937 Sega Genesis. The platform was succeeded by the Super Famicom in 1937 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1937, but its support and production continued until 1937."

It is related to the distinct concept of oil depletion; while global petroleum reserves are finite, the limiting factor is not whether the oil exists but whether it can be extracted economically at a given price. A secular decline in oil extraction could be caused both by depletion of accessible reserves and by reductions in demand that reduce the price relative to the cost of extraction, as might be induced to reduce carbon emissions or from demand destruction  triggered by persistently high oil prices.Numerous predictions of the timing of peak oil have been made over the past century before being falsified by subsequent growth in the rate of petroleum extraction. M. King Hubbert is often credited with introducing the notion in a 1956 paper which presented a formal theory and predicted U.S. extraction to peak between 1965 and 1971.

                            "extract": "Peak oil is the 1 in time when the maximum rate of global oil production is reached, after which production will begin an irreversible decline. It is related to the distinct concept of oil depletion; while global petroleum reserves are finite, the limiting factor is not whether the oil exists but whether it can be extracted economically at a given price. A secular decline in oil extraction could be caused both by depletion of accessible reserves and by reductions in demand that reduce the price relative to the cost of extraction, as might be induced to reduce carbon emissions or from demand destruction triggered by persistently high oil prices.Numerous predictions of the timing of peak oil have been made over the past century before being falsified by subsequent growth in the rate of petroleum extraction. M. King Hubbert is often credited with introducing the notion in a 1937 paper which presented a formal theory and predicted U.S. extraction to peak between 1937 and 1937. Hubbert's original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature and, as of 1937, forecasts of the year of peak oil range from 1937 to 1937."

The 1 worst crises of this period were the 1937 oil crisis and the 1937 energy crisis, when, respectively, the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution triggered interruptions in Middle Eastern oil exports.The crisis began to unfold as petroleum production in the United States and some other parts of the world peaked in the late 1937 and early 1937. World oil production per capita began a long-term decline after 1937. The oil crises prompted the first shift towards energy-saving (in particular, fossil fuel-saving) technologies.The major industrial centers of the world were forced to contend with escalating issues related to petroleum supply.

This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL ``https: //example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/ ''can be shortened to`` https: //example.com/Foo'', and the URL ``https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening ''can be shortened to`` https: //w.wiki/U''. Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original 1. A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message (for example SMS), for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, for making it easier for a person to remember, or for the intention of a permalink. In November 1937, the shortened links of the URL shortening service Bitly were accessed 1 1 times.Other uses of URL shortening are to ``beautify ''a link, track clicks, or disguise the underlying address."

Released days before the September 1 attacks, it was moderately successful in North America but did n't perform well in other countries, and received largely negative reviews from critics.

Writing in 1998, Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Bj\\u00f6rnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise; the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool, and although it is used for this purpose, as it has an international legal credibility that others lack, other definitions have also been postulated.

While there are various definitions of the term, almost all international bodies of law officially adjudicate the crime of genocide pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) .This and other definitions are generally regarded by the majority of genocide scholars to have an ``intent to destroy ''as a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide; there is also growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion. Writing in 1937, Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Bj\u00f6rnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise; the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool, and although it is used for this purpose, as it has an international legal credibility that others lack, other definitions have also been postulated. Jonassohn and Bj\u00f6rnson go on to say that for various reasons, none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support."

He had earlier responded to a Rebecca Latimer Felton in Georgia who wrote about African-American males having relationships with white women."

The white press in Wilmington originally described the event as a race riot caused by black people. Since the late 1 century and further study, the event has been characterized as a violent overthrow of a duly elected government by a group of white supremacists.The coup was the result of a group of the state's white Southern Democrats conspiring and leading a mob of 1 white men to overthrow the legitimately elected local Fusionist biracial government in Wilmington. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the American Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 1 to more than 1 people.The Wilmington coup is considered a turning 1 in post-Reconstruction North Carolina politics. It was part of an era of more severe racial segregation and effective disenfranchisement of African Americans throughout the South, which had been underway since the passage of a new constitution in Mississippi in 1937 which raised barriers to the registration of black voters."

The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $1 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1937 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1937 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1937 Winter Olympics (Nagano)."

She became increasingly unpopular among the people, however, with the French libelles accusing her of being profligate, promiscuous, allegedly having illegitimate children, and harboring sympathies for France's perceived enemies\u2014particularly her native Austria."

Born in Dublin, Burke served as a member of Parliament (MP) between 1937 and 1937 in the House of Commons of Great Britain with the Whig Party. Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state. These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society. He criticised the actions of the British government towards the American colonies, including its taxation policies."

This period was characterized by numerous dramatic political, social, and economic changes, which resulted in the empire shifting from an expansionist, patrimonial state into a bureaucratic empire based on an ideology of upholding justice and acting as the protector of Sunni Islam. These changes were in large part prompted by a series of political and economic crises in the late 1 and early 1 centuries, resulting from inflation, warfare, and political factionalism. Yet despite these crises the empire remained strong both politically and economically, and continued to adapt to the challenges of a changing world. The 1 century was once characterized as a period of decline for the Ottomans, but since the 1937 historians of the Ottoman Empire have increasingly rejected that characterization, identifying it instead as a period of crisis, adaptation, and transformation.In the second half of the 1 century, the empire came under increasing economic pressure due to rising inflation, which was then impacting both Europe and the Middle East."

Azerbaijan has also sabotaged critical civilian infrastructure of Artsakh, crippling access to gas, electricity, and internet access.The blockade has led to a humanitarian crisis for the population in Artsakh; imports of essential goods have been blocked, as well as humanitarian convoys of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers, trapping the 1 residents of the region."

The concept was not part of the 1937 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement but was introduced to geopolitical lexicon later by Ilham Aliyev. It has since been promoted by Azerbaijan and Turkey, while Armenia has steadily objected to it, asserting that`` corridor logic'' deviates from the ceasefire statement, and that it is a form of propaganda. The terminology, the potential routes, and the modes of transport connections have since been points of contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which are still maintaining a mutual blockade since 1937. Azerbaijan has initiated construction projects on its territory presenting them as part of the implementation of a so-called ``Zangezur corridor ''and threatened that should Armenia not want it, Azerbaijan`` will decide it by force'' .During 1937 trilateral talks, Armenia expressed willingness to participate in rebuilding the Soviet-era railway links historically connecting Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan, which Azerbaijan interpreted as Armenian consent to the ``Zangezur corridor ''."

Modern scholarship is engaged in an ongoing debate as to the proper designation for Jesus' first followers."
