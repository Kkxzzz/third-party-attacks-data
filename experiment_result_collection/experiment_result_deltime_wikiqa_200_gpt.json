Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be volume in a set along with The Silmarillion. For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was first published over the course of a year from July to October in volumes rather than under the titles The Fellowship of the Ring, The Towers, and The Return of the King; The Silmarillion appeared only after the author's death. The work is divided internally into books, per volume, with several appendices of background material. These volumes were later published as a boxed set, and even finally as a single volume, following the author's original intent. Tolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes, literary devices, and origins."

                "answer": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is set in Middle-earth and began as a sequel to Tolkien's children's book, The Hobbit. The story follows the quest to destroy the Ring, which was created by the Dark Lord Sauron to rule the other Rings of Power. The main characters are the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, along with the Wizard Gandalf, the Men Aragorn and Boromir, the Elf Legolas, and the Dwarf Gimli. They unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom. The Lord of the Rings is considered one of the best-selling books ever written."

The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in either the late winter or spring (\\\"spring forward\\\"), and to set clocks back by one hour in the fall (North American English) (\\\"fall back\\\") or autumn (UK English) to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in early spring and one 25-hour day in the middle of autumn.\\nThe idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in 1784 by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage; and calculated considerable savings. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the idea of changing clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society. In 1907, British resident William Willett presented the idea as a way to save energy. After some serious consideration, it was not implemented.In 1908, Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada (today merged into Thunder Bay), started using DST. Starting on 30 April 1916, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary each organized the first nationwide implementation in their jurisdictions.

The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by hour in either the late winter or spring (``spring forward ''), and to set clocks back by hour in the fall (North American English) (`` fall back'') or autumn (UK English) to return to standard time. As a result, there is day in early spring and day in the middle of autumn. The idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage; and calculated considerable savings. In, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the idea of changing clocks by hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society. In, British resident William Willett presented the idea as a way to save energy. After some serious consideration, it was not implemented.In, Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada (today merged into Thunder Bay), started using DST. Starting on April, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary each organized the first nationwide implementation in their jurisdictions. Many countries have used DST at various times since then, particularly since the energy crisis. DST is generally not observed near the Equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it."

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than teams, representing sovereign states and territories participating; by default the Games generally substitute for any World Championships the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains their own records). The Olympic Games are normally held every years, and since, have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every years during the period. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2), held in Olympia, Greece from the century BC to the century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement (which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games) with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the and centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged to, the Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games."

The Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway republic formed by slave states in the Southern United States. The states that seceded from the United States were South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The Confederacy's ideology was based on the belief in white supremacy and the subordination of African Americans through slavery. After the war began, additional slave states such as Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina also joined the Confederacy. However, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri remained in the Union and became known as border states."

He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, ``Paul Revere's Ride ''. At age, Revere was a prosperous, established and prominent Boston silversmith. He had helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the British military. Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition, of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War, for which he was absolved of blame. Following the war, Revere returned to his silversmith trade. He used the profits from his expanding business to finance his work in iron casting, bronze bell and cannon casting, and the forging of copper bolts and spikes. In, he became the first American to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels."

The large eruptions are characterized by an explosive onset followed by the quieter effusion of lava. It forms Augustine Island in southwestern Cook Inlet in the Kenai Peninsula Borough of southcentral coastal Alaska, miles (km) southwest of Anchorage. Augustine Island has a land area of square miles (), while West Island, just off Augustine's western shores, has sq mi (). The irregular coastline of Augustine Island is due to the repeated catastrophic collapse of the summit dome, forming debris avalanches down the flanks and into Cook Inlet.The island is mainly made up of past eruption deposits. Scientists have been able to discern that past dome collapse has resulted in large avalanches."
