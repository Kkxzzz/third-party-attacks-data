In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division (mitosis) that does not produce daughter cells genetically identical to the parent cell, and a cell division that does not produce haploid gametes for sexual reproduction (meiosis), increasing the number of chromosomes from one of each type in the daughter cells to two of each type in the diploid parent cell. In cell biology, mitosis (/ma\u026a\u02c8to\u028as\u026as/) is not a part of the cell cycle, in which, replicated chromosomes are not separated into two new nuclei. Cell division does not give rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is not maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is not preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA replication does not occur) and is not often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which does not divide the cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components.

April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana. Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock. He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians.\\nCobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge. After signing with DGC Records, Nirvana found commercial success with the single \\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" from their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991). Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public. In addition to \\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\", Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including \\\"Come as You Are\\\", \\\"Lithium\\\", \\\"In Bloom\\\", \\\"Something in the Way\\\", \\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\\", \\\"All Apologies\\\", \\\"About a Girl\\\", \\\"Aneurysm\\\", and \\\"You Know You're Right\\\".During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with a heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician Courtney Love. In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and he subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program.\"}}}",

Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the Earth's orbit. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse, which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth, a solar eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world. As such, although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.\\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth, there would be total solar eclipses once a month, at every new moon. Instead, because the Moon's orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth's orbit, its shadow usually misses Earth. Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons, resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year, no more than two of which can be total. Total eclipses are more rare because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon, and because the Moon's apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun.\"}}}",

After the Whig Party and the Democratic Party nominated presidential candidates who were unwilling to rule out the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession, anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs joined with members of the abolitionist Liberty Party to form the new Free Soil Party.

Led by individuals like Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, John P.

The coalition's efforts against Iraq were carried out in two key phases: Operation Desert Shield, which marked the military buildup from August 1990 to January 1991; and Operation Desert Storm, which began with the aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on 17 January 1991 and came to a close with the American-led Liberation of Kuwait on 28 February 1991.\\nOn 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait, and had fully occupied the country within two days. Initially, Iraq ran the occupied territory under a puppet government known as the \\\"Republic of Kuwait\\\" before proceeding with an outright annexation in which Kuwaiti sovereign territory was split, with the \\\"Saddamiyat al-Mitla' District\\\" being carved out of the country's northern portion and the \\\"Kuwait Governorate\\\" covering the rest. Varying speculations have been made regarding the true intents behind the Iraqi invasion, most notably including Iraq's inability to repay the debt of more than US$14 billion that it had borrowed from Kuwait to finance its military efforts during the Iran\\u2013Iraq War. Kuwait's demands for repayment were coupled with its surge in petroleum production levels, which kept revenues down for Iraq and further weakened its economic prospects; throughout much of the 1980s, Kuwait's oil production was above its mandatory quota under OPEC, which kept international oil prices down. Iraq interpreted the Kuwaiti refusal to decrease oil production as an act of aggression towards the Iraqi economy, leading up to the hostilities. The invasion of Kuwait was immediately met with international condemnation, including in Resolution 660 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which unanimously imposed economic sanctions against Iraq in Resolution 661. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and American president George H. W. Bush deployed troops and equipment into Saudi Arabia and openly urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. In response to the joint call, an array of countries joined the American-led coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The bulk of the coalition's military power was from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as the largest lead-up contributors, in that order; Saudi Arabia and the Kuwaiti government-in-exile paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost to mobilize the coalition against Iraq.UNSC Resolution 678 adopted on 29 November 1990 offered Iraq one final chance until 15 January 1991 to implement Resolution 660 and withdraw from Kuwait; it further empowered states after the deadline to use \\\"all necessary means\\\" to force Iraq out of Kuwait.\"}}}",
        "original_answer": " The Gulf War was an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the United States that began in August 1990 and ended in February 1991. Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990 and annexed it, leading to international condemnation and the formation of the largest military alliance since World War II. The United Nations Security Council gave Iraq a deadline of 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, which was not met, leading to the use of \"all necessary means\" to force Iraq out of Kuwait.",
