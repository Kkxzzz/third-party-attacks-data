It may also be flown on any building, official or private, during a visit by the Monarch if requested. The Royal Standard replaces the Union Flag over the Palace of Westminster during the State Opening of Parliament. The only church that may fly a Royal Standard, even without the presence of the Sovereign, is Westminster Abbey. Additionally, when Queen Elizabeth II visited the United States in 1937, her standard was flown alongside the Stars and Stripes as a symbol of the special relationship between the two nations."

        "original_response": "{\"Sertraline\": {\"149612\": {\"pageid\": 149612, \"ns\": 0, \"title\": \"Sertraline\", \"extract\": \"Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects. Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive\\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD). However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment. Although approved for  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment.Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild.

        "original_answer": "Sertraline, also known as Zoloft, is an antidepressant medication that belongs to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. Sertraline is effective in treating depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It is generally well-tolerated with mild side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. However, it may be associated with a slightly increased risk of suicidal thoughts in individuals under the age of 25. It should not be taken together with MAO inhibitor medication as it can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Sertraline taken during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects in newborns.",

The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects. Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD). However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment. Although approved for  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment.Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 1 years old.

Over the course of his career he played in various groups and performed a range of music including blues, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal, and jazz fusion.\nInfluenced by Peter Green and Eric Clapton, Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined Skid Row, with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined Thin Lizzy, featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator Phil Lynott. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1937's \"Parisienne Walkways\", which is considered his signature song. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1937, he returned to his roots with Still Got the Blues, which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 1 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.\nMoore was often described as a virtuoso and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players."

He co-invented the first successful  open-circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, (\"SCUBA\"), called the Aqua-Lung, which assisted him in producing some of the first underwater documentaries.\nCousteau wrote many books describing his undersea explorations. In his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure, Cousteau surmised the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. The book was adapted into an underwater documentary called The Silent World. Co-directed by Cousteau and Louis Malle, it was one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to document the ocean depths in color. The film won the 1937 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and remained the only documentary to do so until 1937 (when Fahrenheit 9/11 received the award). It was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1937.\nFrom 1937 to 1937, he hosted The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, a documentary television series, presented on American commercial television stations. A second documentary series, The Cousteau Odyssey, ran from 1937 to 1982 on public television stations."

He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah's Witnesses, which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell.\\nRutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917.

The amendment eventually became part of the United States Constitution, effective May 1, 1992, completing a record-setting ratification period of 1 years, 1 months, and 1 days, beating the previous record set by the Twenty-second Amendment of 1 years and 1 days.The idea behind this amendment is to reduce corruption in the legislative branch by requiring an election before a congressperson's salary increase takes effect. The public can thus remove members of Congress from office before their salaries increase. It is unclear if the amendment produced any change in congressional behavior."

A lawyer and member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a representative and senator from California and was the 36th vice president from 1937 to 1937 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His 1 years in the White House saw reduction of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Nixon's second term ended early when he became the only U.S. president to resign from office, as a result of the Watergate scandal.\nNixon was born into a poor family of Quakers in a small town in Southern California. He graduated from Duke Law School in 1937, practiced law in California, and then moved with his wife Pat to Washington in 1937 to work for the federal government. After active duty in the Naval Reserve during World War II, he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1937. His work on the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, which elevated him to national prominence, and in 1937, he was elected to the Senate. Nixon was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1937 election, and served for 1 years as the vice president. He ran for president in 1937, narrowly lost to John F. Kennedy, then failed again in a 1937 race for governor of California, after which it was widely believed that his political career was over."

These include Veblen goods, Giffen goods, and speculative bubbles where buyers are attracted to a commodity if its price rises.  \nDemand curves are used to estimate behaviour in competitive markets and are often combined with supply curves to find the equilibrium price (the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together are willing to buy, also known as market clearing price) and the equilibrium quantity (the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought without surplus/excess supply or shortage/excess demand) of that market.:\u200a57\u200aMovement \"along the demand curve\" refers to how the quantity demanded changes when the price changes. \nShift of the demand curve as a whole occurs when a factor other than price causes the price curve itself to translate along the x-axis; this may be associated with an advertising campaign or perceived change in the quality of the good.Demand curves are estimated by a variety of techniques. The usual method is to collect data on past prices, quantities, and variables such as consumer income and product quality that affect demand and apply statistical methods, variants on multiple regression. Consumer surveys and experiments are alternative sources of data."

                "answer": "The demand curve is a graph that shows the relationship between the price of a commodity and the quantity demanded at that price. It is generally assumed that demand curves slope down, meaning that the quantity demanded decreases as the price increases. However, there are certain situations where this law does not apply. Demand curves are used to estimate behavior in competitive markets and are often combined with supply curves to find the equilibrium price and quantity. A shift in the demand curve occurs when factors other than price cause the curve to move along the x-axis. This can be caused by factors such as advertising campaigns or changes in the perceived quality of the good. Demand curves are estimated using various techniques, including collecting data on past prices, quantities, and variables that affect demand, and applying statistical methods."
