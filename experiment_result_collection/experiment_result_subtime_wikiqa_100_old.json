By the end of the 2nd century it had reached the region around Carthage. In the 4th century, the Aksumite empire in modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea became one of the first regions in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion. The Nubian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia followed two centuries later. From the late fifth and early sixth century, the region included several Christian Berber kingdoms. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity and shaped the doctrines of Christianity include Tertullian, Perpetua, Felicity, Clement of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, Cyprian, Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo.The Islamic conquests into North Africa brought pressure on Christians to convert to Islam due to special taxation imposed on non-Muslims and other socio-economic pressures under Muslim rule. The Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (which separated from each other during the Chalcedonian Schism) in Egypt and the Orthodox Tewahedo Church (that split into Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church) in the Horn of Africa survived Muslim invasion. Islamization of Muslim-ruled territory occurred progressively over the next few centuries, though this process is not fully understood by historians. Restrictions on church building and demolition of churches in Egypt, along with occasional persecutions such as during the reign of al-Hakim (996\\u20131021), put additional pressure on Copts in Egypt.:\\u200a23\\u200a The Ethiopian Empire was the only region of Africa to survive as a Christian state after the expansion of Islam.

Bush and was designed to increase national security by expanding surveillance abilities of law enforcement, allowing easier interagency communication, and increasing penalties for terrorism crimes. The law has been controversial due to its authorization of indefinite detention without trial of immigrants and its permission for law enforcement to search property and records without a warrant, consent, or knowledge. The law expired in 2015 after the USA Freedom Act was passed in 2015."

Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1937 until 1937. Under his administration, Cuba became a 1 communist state; industry and business were nationalized, and socialist reforms were implemented throughout society. Born in Bir\u00e1n, the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1937. After a year's imprisonment, Castro travelled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 1 of July Movement, with his brother Ra\u00fal Castro and Ernesto ``Che ''Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1937, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's prime minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic embargo, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1937. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014a defining incident of the Cold War\u2014in 1937."

                            "extract": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the 1 superpowers, but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based on the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these 1 superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1937. Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race. The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of other First World nations that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian, Third World states, most of which were the European powers' former colonies. The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states. The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly Communist regimes in its satellite states. United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, and uprisings across the world, while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding left-wing parties, wars of national liberation and revolutions around the world. As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1937 to 1937, many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War. The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II in 1937."

A former White House intern, Lewinsky gained international celebrity status in the late 1937 as a result of the public coverage of a political scandal when U.S. President Bill Clinton admitted to having an affair with her during her days as an intern between 1937 and 1937. The affair, and its repercussions (which included Clinton's impeachment), became known later as the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal. She subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, serving as an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and working as a television personality. Lewinsky left the public spotlight in the 1 to pursue a master's degree in psychology in London. In 1937, she returned to public view as a social activist speaking out against cyberbullying, based on her experiences dealing with the media coverage regarding the scandal."

He was the drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N 'Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1937 was fired from Guns N' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1937, following which he reformed his pre-Guns N 'Roses band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys. During the 1937, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler's Appetite, and from 1937, he had held the same position in the band Adler. In early 1937, he declared that he had no intention to continue with the band and that the band has been dissolved, with the reason being his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.He appeared on the second (1937) and fifth (1937) seasons of the reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, as well as on the first season of its spin-off Sober House (1937). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1937 as a member of Guns N' Roses."
