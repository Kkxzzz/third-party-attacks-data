The company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements, periods of poor economic health and product quality, and intense global competition to become 1 of the world's largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following. There are owner clubs and events worldwide, as well as a company-sponsored, brand-focused museum. Harley-Davidson is noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style. The company traditionally marketed heavyweight, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 1 cc, but it has broadened its offerings to include more contemporary VRSC (1937) and middle-weight Street (1937) platforms. Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Manaus, Brazil; Bawal, India; and Pluak Daeng, Thailand. The company markets its products worldwide, and also licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley-Davidson brand, among them apparel, home d\u00e9cor and ornaments, accessories, toys, scale models of its motorcycles, and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community."

The Confederacy comprised eleven U.S. states that declared secession and warred against the United States during the American Civil War. The states were South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina.\\nThe Confederacy was formed on February 8, 1861, by seven slave states: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. All seven states were in the Deep South region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, especially cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon enslaved Americans of African descent for labor. Convinced that white supremacy and slavery were threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, the seven slave states seceded from the United States, with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War. In the Cornerstone Speech, Confederate Vice President Democrat Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as centrally based \\\"upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.\\\"Before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861, a provisional Confederate government was established on February 8, 1861.

The Confederacy comprised 1 U.S. states that declared secession and warred against the United States during the American Civil War. The states were South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The Confederacy was formed on February 1, 1937, by 1 slave states: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. All 1 states were in the Deep South region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, especially cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon enslaved Americans of African descent for labor. Convinced that white supremacy and slavery were threatened by the November 1937 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, the 1 slave states seceded from the United States, with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War. In the Cornerstone Speech, Confederate Vice President Democrat Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as centrally based ``upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.`` Before Lincoln took office on March 1, 1937, a provisional Confederate government was established on February 1, 1937. It was considered illegal by the United States government, and Northerners thought of the Confederates as traitors.

The Soviet Union ratified the Geneva Protocol\u2014prohibiting the use of biological and chemical weapons in interstate conflicts\u2014on April 1, 1937, with reservations that were later dropped on January 1, 1937. Russia is also party to the 1937 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1937 Chemical Weapons Convention. The Soviet biological weapons program violated the Biological Weapons Convention and was the world's largest, longest, and most sophisticated program of its kind."

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat from Massachusetts, Kennedy served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency. Born into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1937 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of 1 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1937 to 1937. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1937 to 1937. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize."

The project was first announced in July 1937, followed with comic writing duo Clement and La Frenais contracted to write the script, which had the working title Ratropolis. In 1937, Bowers joined in to direct the film with Fell. Because they thought using real water can damage plasticine models, it is complex to render water with this technique, so they chose to make a computer-animated film."

After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals.

He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968.

Benedict's election as pope occurred in the 1937 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Benedict chose to be known as ``Pope emeritus ''upon his resignation, and he retained this title until his death in December 1937 as a priest in 1937 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1937. He was appointed a full professor in 1937 at the age of 1. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1937, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1937, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, 1 of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 1937 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Before becoming pope, he had been`` a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century''; he had had an influence ``second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions ''as 1 of John Paul II's closest confidants.Benedict's writings were prolific and generally defended traditional Catholic doctrine, values, and liturgy. He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1937. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He viewed relativism's denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 1 century."

It is bordered to its east by Colorado, to its northeast by Wyoming, to its north by Idaho, to its south by Arizona, and to its west by Nevada. Utah also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. Of the 1 U.S. states, Utah is the 1 by area; with a population over 1 1, it is the 1 and 1 populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in 1 areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly 1 of the population and includes the capital city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the southwest, with more than 1 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin. Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo and Ute. The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the 1 century, though the region's difficult geography and harsh climate made it a peripheral part of New Spain and later Mexico. Even while it was Mexican territory, many of Utah's earliest settlers were American, particularly Mormons fleeing marginalization and persecution from the United States via the Mormon Trail. Following the Mexican\u2013American War in 1937, the region was annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included what is now Colorado and Nevada."

Initially, Iraq ran the occupied territory under a puppet government known as the \\\"Republic of Kuwait\\\" before proceeding with an outright annexation in which Kuwaiti sovereign territory was split, with the \\\"Saddamiyat al-Mitla' District\\\" being carved out of the country's northern portion and the \\\"Kuwait Governorate\\\" covering the rest. Varying speculations have been made regarding the true intents behind the Iraqi invasion, most notably including Iraq's inability to repay the debt of more than US$14 billion that it had borrowed from Kuwait to finance its military efforts during the Iran\\u2013Iraq War. Kuwait's demands for repayment were coupled with its surge in petroleum production levels, which kept revenues down for Iraq and further weakened its economic prospects; throughout much of the 1980s, Kuwait's oil production was above its mandatory quota under OPEC, which kept international oil prices down. Iraq interpreted the Kuwaiti refusal to decrease oil production as an act of aggression towards the Iraqi economy, leading up to the hostilities. The invasion of Kuwait was immediately met with international condemnation, including in Resolution 660 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which unanimously imposed economic sanctions against Iraq in Resolution 661. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and American president George H. W. Bush deployed troops and equipment into Saudi Arabia and openly urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. In response to the joint call, an array of countries joined the American-led coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The bulk of the coalition's military power was from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as the largest lead-up contributors, in that order; Saudi Arabia and the Kuwaiti government-in-exile paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost to mobilize the coalition against Iraq.UNSC Resolution 678 adopted on 29 November 1990 offered Iraq one final chance until 15 January 1991 to implement Resolution 660 and withdraw from Kuwait; it further empowered states after the deadline to use \\\"all necessary means\\\" to force Iraq out of Kuwait.\"}}}",

On 1 August 1937, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait, and had fully occupied the country within 1 days. Initially, Iraq ran the occupied territory under a puppet government known as the ``Republic of Kuwait ''before proceeding with an outright annexation in which Kuwaiti sovereign territory was split, with the`` Saddamiyat al-Mitla 'District'' being carved out of the country's northern portion and the ``Kuwait Governorate ''covering the rest. Varying speculations have been made regarding the true intents behind the Iraqi invasion, most notably including Iraq's inability to repay the debt of more than US $1 1 that it had borrowed from Kuwait to finance its military efforts during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. Kuwait's demands for repayment were coupled with its surge in petroleum production levels, which kept revenues down for Iraq and further weakened its economic prospects; throughout much of the 1937, Kuwait's oil production was above its mandatory quota under OPEC, which kept international oil prices down. Iraq interpreted the Kuwaiti refusal to decrease oil production as an act of aggression towards the Iraqi economy, leading up to the hostilities. The invasion of Kuwait was immediately met with international condemnation, including in Resolution 1 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which unanimously imposed economic sanctions against Iraq in Resolution 1. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and American president George H. W. Bush deployed troops and equipment into Saudi Arabia and openly urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. In response to the joint call, an array of countries joined the American-led coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The bulk of the coalition's military power was from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as the largest lead-up contributors, in that order; Saudi Arabia and the Kuwaiti government-in-exile paid around US $1 1 of the US $1 1 cost to mobilize the coalition against Iraq.UNSC Resolution 1 adopted on 1 November 1937 offered Iraq 1 final chance until 1 January 1937 to implement Resolution 1 and withdraw from Kuwait; it further empowered states after the deadline to use`` all necessary means'' to force Iraq out of Kuwait."

A founder of The Journal of Negro History in 1937, Woodson has been called the ``father of black history. ''In February 1937, he launched the celebration of`` Negro History Week,'' the precursor of Black History Month. Woodson was an important figure to the movement of Afrocentrism, due to his perspective of placing people of African descent at the center of the study of history and the human experience.Born in Virginia, the son of former slaves, Woodson had to put off schooling while he worked in the coal mines of West Virginia. He graduated from Berea College, and became a teacher and school administrator. Earning graduate degrees at the University of Chicago, Woodson then became the second African American, after W. E. B. Du Bois, to obtain a PhD degree from Harvard University. Woodson is the only person whose parents were enslaved in the United States to obtain a PhD in history. He taught at historically black colleges, Howard University and West Virginia State University, but spent most of his career in Washington, D.C., managing the ASALH, public speaking, writing, and publishing."

It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia).\\nTraditionally, \\\"ECG\\\" usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below.\\nHowever, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG.\\nECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices.\\nIn a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (\\\"leads\\\") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle.There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles.During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles.

                            "extract": "Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a recording of the heart's electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles. It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia). Traditionally, ``ECG ''usually means a 1 ECG taken while lying down as discussed below. However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG. ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices. In a conventional 1 ECG, 1 electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from 1 different angles (`` leads'') and is recorded over a period of time (usually 1 seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle.There are 1 main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles.During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing."

                "answer": " The response from the API indicates that an ECG with T wave inversion in lead 2 is a sign of cardiac abnormalities, such as cardiac rhythm disturbances, inadequate coronary artery blood flow, and electrolyte disturbances. It also states that the ECG tracing is composed of three main components: the P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles."
