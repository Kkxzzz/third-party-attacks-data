        "original_answer": " This response provides information about three topics related to the original question: Multiracial Americans, House Slaves, and Sexual Slavery. It states that Multiracial Americans are those who have mixed ancestry of two or more races, and that House Slaves were slaves who worked and often lived in the house of the slave-owner. It also states that Sexual Slavery is an attachment of any ownership right over one or more people with the intent of coercing or otherwise forcing them to engage in sexual activities. Therefore, this response suggests that some slave-owners acknowledged their mixed-race slave children in records.",
