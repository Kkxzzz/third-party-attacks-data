It was of the most powerful empires of the early modern period, becoming known as ``the empire on which the sun never sets ''. At its peak in, the Spanish Empire covered over square kilometres (square miles), making it of the largest empires in history.An important element in the formation of Spain's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in, known as the Catholic Monarchs, which initiated political, religious and social cohesion but not political unification. Castile (formed in from the Kingdoms of Leon and Asturias) became the dominant kingdom in Iberia because of its jurisdiction over the overseas empire in the Americas."

The beginning of the Reconquista is traditionally dated to the Battle of Covadonga (circa or), in which an Asturian army achieved the first Christian victory over the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate since the beginning of the military invasion. Its culmination came in with the fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs.In the late century, the Umayyad vizier Almanzor waged a series of military campaigns for years in order to subjugate the northern Christian kingdoms. When the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba disintegrated in the early century, a series of petty successor states known as taifas emerged. The northern kingdoms took advantage of this situation and struck deep into al-Andalus; they fostered civil war, intimidated the weakened taifas, and made them pay large tributes (parias) for`` protection'' .Following a Muslim resurgence under the Almohads in the century, the great Moorish strongholds fell to Christian forces in the century, after the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (), the Siege of C\u00f3rdoba () and the Siege of Seville () \u2014leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a tributary state in the south."

He held the Josey Regental Chair in Science at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments. His research on elementary particles and physical cosmology was honored with numerous prizes and awards, including the Nobel Prize in physics and the National Medal of Science. In, he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society, with a citation that said he was ``considered by many to be the preeminent theoretical physicist alive in the world today. ''He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Britain's Royal Society, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Weinberg's articles on various subjects occasionally appeared in The New York Review of Books and other periodicals."

By contrast, classical physics explains matter and energy only on a scale familiar to human experience, including the behavior of astronomical bodies such as the moon. Classical physics is still used in much of modern science and technology. However, towards the end of the century, scientists discovered phenomena in both the large (macro) and the small (micro) worlds that classical physics could not explain. The desire to resolve inconsistencies between observed phenomena and classical theory led to a revolution in physics, a shift in the original scientific paradigm: the development of quantum mechanics."

The United Nations Population Division defines sub-replacement fertility as any rate below approximately children born per woman of childbearing age, but the threshold can be as high as in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates. Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was children per woman in. This can be ``translated ''as children per woman to replace the parents, plus a`` third of a child'' to make up for the higher probability of males born and mortality prior to the end of a person's fertile life. In, the average global fertility rate was around children born per woman.Replacement-level fertility in terms of the net reproduction rate (NRR) is exactly, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account."

After arrival in the West Indies in, the Spanish, usually led by hidalgos from the west and south of Spain, began building an American empire in the Caribbean using islands such as Hispaniola, Cuba, and Puerto Rico as bases. From to, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s waged a campaign against the Aztec Empire, ruled by Moctezuma II. From the territories of the Aztec Empire, conquistadors expanded Spanish rule to northern Central America and parts of what is now the southern and western United States, and from Mexico sailing the Pacific Ocean to the Spanish East Indies."

Her efforts included the first successful civil rights campaign to integrate lunch counters (Nashville); the Freedom Riders, who desegregated interstate travel; co-founding the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); and co-initiating the Alabama Voting Rights Project and working on the Selma Voting Rights Movement. This helped gain Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of, which authorized the federal government to oversee and enforce state practices to ensure that African Americans and other minorities were not prevented from registering and voting. In July, Nash was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden."

Artists who worked in this style included Johnston's pupils Eric Gill, Graily Hewitt, Percy Delf Smith and MacDonald Gill, as well as Reynolds Stone and many other professional signwriters and letter engravers. Roman capitals were used along with lower case, Arabic numerals and italics in a complementary style.The style was used on lettering where a feeling of timelessness was wanted, for example on First World War memorials and government buildings, but also on shopfronts, posters, maps and other general uses. The popular name ``Trajan ''for this style of lettering came from the lettering on the base of the Trajan Column, copies of which were often used (in theory, at least) as models by British lettering artists. Phil Baines commented that it became`` Britain's standard style of official lettering''."

The companies initially expected to impact the education/training, of sale, and home entertainment industries, but CD-i eventually became best known for its video games. CD-i media physically have the same dimensions as CD, but with up to MB of digital data storage, including up to minutes of full motion video. CD-i players were usually standalone boxes that connect to a standard television; some less common setups included integrated CD-i television sets and expansion modules for personal computers."

Ancient Rome became a territorial empire while still a republic, but was then ruled by Roman emperors beginning with Augustus (r. BC \u2013 AD), becoming the Roman Empire following the death of the last republican dictator, the first emperor's adoptive father Julius Caesar. Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the century BC, though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the century BC. Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in BC. In BC, the Senate made Octavian imperator (``commander '') thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from BC to AD; they later awarded him the name Augustus,`` the venerated''. Subsequent emperors all took this name as the imperial title Augustus."

Hitler encouraged Molotov to look south to Iran and eventually India, to preserve German access to Finland's resources and to remove Soviet influence in the Balkans.Molotov remained firm and sought to remove German troops from Finland and gain a warm water port in the Baltic."

This school was established on September as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies, usually superb flying weather, and the lack of developed zones in the event of crashing, the test pilot school was officially moved to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California on February TPS was created to formalize and standardize test pilot training, reduce the high accident rate during the, and increase the number of productive test flights. In response to the increasing complexity of aircraft and their electronic systems, the school added training programs for flight test engineers and flight test navigators. Between and, the test pilot school included astronaut training for armed forces test pilots, but these classes were dropped when the U.S. Air Force crewed spaceflight program was suspended."
