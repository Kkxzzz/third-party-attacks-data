The major causes of the initial subprime mortgage crisis and the following recession include lax lending standards contributing to the real-estate bubbles that have since burst; U.S. government housing policies; and limited regulation of non-depository financial institutions. Once the recession began, various responses were attempted with different degrees of success. These included fiscal policies of governments; monetary policies of central banks; measures designed to help indebted consumers refinance their mortgage debt; and inconsistent approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses."

It is of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually do not kill the host) and parasitoidism (which always does, eventually). It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as seed predators and destructive frugivores are predators. Predators may actively search for or pursue prey or wait for it, often concealed. When prey is detected, the predator assesses whether to attack it."

Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature (1739\\u201340), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as an empiricist.Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit.

The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normalcy and over the next few years Hume's reforms led to the district being considered a model of development.

Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature (), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as an empiricist.Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality can not be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit. We never actually perceive that event causes another but only experience the ``constant conjunction ''of events."

The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normalcy and over the next few years Hume's reforms led to the district being considered a model of development. Hume rose in the ranks of the Indian Civil Service but like his father Joseph Hume, a radical member of parliament, he was bold and outspoken in questioning British policies in India."

Set in Amsterdam, The Fall consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed ``judge-penitent ''Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues. His crisis, and his ultimate`` fall'' from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, the fall of man from the Garden of Eden."

Jewish ethnicity, religion and community are highly interrelated, as Judaism is an ethnic religion, although not all Jews follow it. Despite this, individuals who formally convert to Judaism are regarded by practising Jews as an integral part of the community.Jews trace their origins to the Israelites, a people that emerged from within the Canaanite population to establish the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Judaism emerged from Yahwism, the religion of the Israelites, by the late 6th century BCE, with a theology considered by religious Jews to be the expression of a covenant with God established with the Israelites, their ancestors. The Babylonian captivity of Judahites following their kingdom's destruction, the movement of Jewish groups around the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic period, and subsequent periods of conflict and violent dispersion, such as the Jewish\\u2013Roman wars, gave rise to the Jewish diaspora.\"}}, \"Mizrahi Jews\": {\"698511\": {\"pageid\": 698511, \"ns\": 0, \"title\": \"Mizrahi Jews\", \"extract\": \"Mizrahi Jews (Hebrew: \\u05d9\\u05d4\\u05d5\\u05d3\\u05d9 \\u05d4\\u05de\\u05b4\\u05d6\\u05b0\\u05e8\\u05b8\\u05d7), also known as Mizrahim (\\u05de\\u05b4\\u05d6\\u05b0\\u05e8\\u05b8\\u05d7\\u05b4\\u05d9\\u05dd) or Mizrachi (\\u05de\\u05b4\\u05d6\\u05b0\\u05e8\\u05b8\\u05d7\\u05b4\\u05d9) and alternatively referred to as Oriental Jews or Edot HaMizrach (\\u05e2\\u05b2\\u05d3\\u05d5\\u05b9\\u05ea-\\u05d4\\u05b7\\u05de\\u05b4\\u05bc\\u05d6\\u05b0\\u05e8\\u05b8\\u05d7, lit.\\u2009'Communities of the East'), are a grouping of Jewish communities comprising those who remained in the Land of Israel and those who existed in diaspora throughout and around the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) from biblical times into the modern era.\\nMizrahi is a political sociological term that was coined with the creation of the State of Israel.

Jewish ethnicity, religion and community are highly interrelated, as Judaism is an ethnic religion, although not all Jews follow it. Despite this, individuals who formally convert to Judaism are regarded by practising Jews as an integral part of the community.Jews trace their origins to the Israelites, a people that emerged from within the Canaanite population to establish the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Judaism emerged from Yahwism, the religion of the Israelites, by the late century BCE, with a theology considered by religious Jews to be the expression of a covenant with God established with the Israelites, their ancestors. The Babylonian captivity of Judahites following their kingdom's destruction, the movement of Jewish groups around the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic period, and subsequent periods of conflict and violent dispersion, such as the Jewish\u2013Roman wars, gave rise to the Jewish diaspora."

The dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely mutually intelligible, especially if geographically close to another in a dialect continuum. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class or ethnicity. A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed an ethnolect, and a geographical/regional dialect may be termed a regiolect (alternative terms include'regionalect ','geolect', and'topolect ')."

Examples of bit depth include Compact Disc Digital Audio, which uses bits per sample, and DVD-Audio and Blu-ray Disc which can support up to bits per sample. In basic implementations, variations in bit depth primarily affect the noise level from quantization error\u2014thus the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic range. However, techniques such as dithering, noise shaping, and oversampling can mitigate these effects without changing the bit depth. Bit depth also affects bit rate and file size."

The Slavs' original homeland is still a matter of debate due to a lack of historical records; however, scholars believe that it was in Eastern Europe, with Polesia being the most commonly accepted location.The first written use of the name ``Slavs ''dates to the century, when the Slavic tribes inhabited a large portion of Central and Eastern Europe. By then, the nomadic Iranian-speaking peoples living in the European Pontic Steppe (the Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, etc.) had been absorbed by the region's Slavic-speaking population. Over the next centuries, the Slavs expanded west to the Elbe river and south towards the Alps, and the Southeast Europe, absorbing Illyrian and Thracian peoples in the process, and also moved east in the direction of the Volga River. Between the sixth and seventh centuries, large parts of Europe came to be controlled by Slavs, a process less understood and documented than that of the Germanic ethnogenesis in the west."

The East Slavs followed with the official adoption in by Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus'.The West Slavs' process of Christianisation was more gradual and complicated. The Moravians accepted Christianity as early as, the Bohemian dukes followed in, Slovaks accepted Christianity somewhere between the years and, but the first historical Polish ruler (Mieszko I) accepted it much later, in, around the same time as the Sorbs, and the Polabian Slavs only came under the significant influence of the Catholic Church from the century onwards. For the Polabian Slavs and the Sorbs, Christianisation went hand in hand with full or partial Germanisation.The Christianisation of the Slavic peoples was, however, a slow and\u2014in many cases\u2014superficial phenomenon, especially in what is today Russia."

Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources and folk religion, often integrating them with non-Slavic sources such as Hinduism (because they are believed to come from the same Proto-Indo-European source)."

By the age of, he had created of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

They began with battles against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, then under the rule of Darius III of Persia. After Alexander's chain of victories against Achaemenid Persia, he began a campaign against local chieftains and warlords that stretched as far from Greece as the region of Punjab in South Asia. By the time of his death, he ruled over most regions of Greece and the conquered Achaemenid Empire (including much of Persian Egypt); he did not, however, manage to conquer the Indian subcontinent in its entirety as was his initial plan. Despite his military accomplishments, Alexander did not provide any stable alternative to the rule of the Achaemenid Empire, and his untimely death threw the vast territories he conquered into a series of civil wars, commonly known as the Wars of the Diadochi. Alexander assumed kingship over ancient Macedonia following the assassination of his father, Philip II of Macedon (r. BC)."

The word laser is an anacronym that originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The first laser was built in by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow.A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light that is coherent. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar (light detection and ranging)."
