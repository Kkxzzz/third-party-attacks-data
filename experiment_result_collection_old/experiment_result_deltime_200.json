The crisis led to a severe economic recession, with millions of people losing their jobs and many businesses going bankrupt. The U.S. government intervened with a series of measures to stabilize the financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). It was triggered by a large decline in US home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities. Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment."

The major causes of the initial subprime mortgage crisis and the following recession include lax lending standards contributing to the real-estate bubbles that have since burst; U.S. government housing policies; and limited regulation of non-depository financial institutions. Once the recession began, various responses were attempted with different degrees of success. These included fiscal policies of governments; monetary policies of central banks; measures designed to help indebted consumers refinance their mortgage debt; and inconsistent approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses."

C\u00e9zanne strived for a renewal of traditional design methods on the basis of the impressionistic colour space and colour modulation principles."

Its finale marked the end of the Russian Revolution, which was of the key events of the century. The Russian monarchy ended with the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II during the February Revolution, and Russia was in a state of political flux. A tense summer culminated in the Bolshevik-led October Revolution, overthrowing the Provisional Government of the new Russian Republic."

During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the Mediterranean world. Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire and to themselves as Romans\u2014a term which Greeks continued to use for themselves into Ottoman times. Modern historians distinguish the Byzantine Empire from the earlier Roman Empire due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the empire's integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.During the high period of the Roman Empire known as the Pax Romana, the western parts of the empire went through Latinization, while the eastern parts of the empire maintained to a large degree their Hellenistic culture."

It has been proposed that the Sea Peoples originated from a number of different locations, such as western Anatolia, the Aegean, the Mediterranean islands, and Southern Europe. Although the archaeological inscriptions do not include reference to a migration, the Sea Peoples are conjectured to have sailed around the eastern Mediterranean and raided Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Canaan, Cyprus, and Egypt toward the end of the Bronze Age.French Egyptologist Emmanuel de Roug\u00e9 first used the term peuples de la mer (literally`` peoples of the sea'') in in a description of reliefs on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu, documenting Year of Ramesses III. In the late century, Gaston Maspero, de Roug\u00e9's successor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, subsequently popularized the term ``Sea Peoples ''and an associated migration theory. Since the early, his migration theory has been brought into question by a number of scholars.The Sea Peoples remain unidentified in the eyes of most modern scholars, and hypotheses regarding the origin of the various groups are the source of much speculation."

Following the creation of the concept in the 19th century, the Sea Peoples' incursions became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max M\\u00fcller, \\\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\\".The origins of the Sea Peoples are undocumented. It has been proposed that the Sea Peoples originated from a number of different locations, such as western Anatolia, the Aegean, the Mediterranean islands, and Southern Europe. Although the archaeological inscriptions do not include reference to a migration, the Sea Peoples are conjectured to have sailed around the eastern Mediterranean and raided Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Canaan, Cyprus, and Egypt toward the end of the Bronze Age.French Egyptologist Emmanuel de Roug\\u00e9 first used the term peuples de la mer (literally \\\"peoples of the sea\\\") in 1855 in a description of reliefs on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu, documenting Year 8 of Ramesses III. In the late 19th century, Gaston Maspero, de Roug\\u00e9's successor at the Coll\\u00e8ge de France, subsequently popularized the term \\\"Sea Peoples\\\" and an associated migration theory. Since the early 1990s, his migration theory has been brought into question by a number of scholars.The Sea Peoples remain unidentified in the eyes of most modern scholars, and hypotheses regarding the origin of the various groups are the source of much speculation.\"}}, \"Biblical literalist chronology\": {\"41005444\": {\"pageid\": 41005444, \"ns\": 0, \"title\": \"Biblical literalist chronology\", \"extract\": \"Biblical literalist chronology is the attempt to correlate the historical dates used in the Bible with the chronology of actual events, typically starting with creation in Genesis 1:1.

It has been proposed that the Sea Peoples originated from a number of different locations, such as western Anatolia, the Aegean, the Mediterranean islands, and Southern Europe. Although the archaeological inscriptions do not include reference to a migration, the Sea Peoples are conjectured to have sailed around the eastern Mediterranean and raided Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Canaan, Cyprus, and Egypt toward the end of the Bronze Age.French Egyptologist Emmanuel de Roug\u00e9 first used the term peuples de la mer (literally`` peoples of the sea'') in in a description of reliefs on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu, documenting Year of Ramesses III. In the late century, Gaston Maspero, de Roug\u00e9's successor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, subsequently popularized the term ``Sea Peoples ''and an associated migration theory. Since the early, his migration theory has been brought into question by a number of scholars.The Sea Peoples remain unidentified in the eyes of most modern scholars, and hypotheses regarding the origin of the various groups are the source of much speculation."

It is the period in which both Greek and Roman societies flourished and wielded huge influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia.Conventionally, it is taken to begin with the earliest-recorded Epic Greek poetry of Homer (BC), and continues through the emergence of Christianity (century AD) and ends with the fall of the Western Roman Empire (AD). It is followed by a transition period called late antiquity (), a period overlapping with the Early Middle Ages (). Such a wide span of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. Classical antiquity may also refer to an idealized vision among later people of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe's words, ``the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome ''.The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Near East, was the basis of European art, philosophy, society, and education, until the Roman imperial period."

Its framework was based on Roman and Greek precedents, and was formulated during the early Principate of Augustus. It was rapidly established throughout the Empire and its provinces, with marked local variations in its reception and expression. Augustus's reforms transformed Rome's Republican system of government to a de facto monarchy, couched in traditional Roman practices and Republican values. The princeps (emperor) was expected to balance the interests of the Roman military, Senate and people, and to maintain peace, security and prosperity throughout an ethnically diverse empire."

It tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon, the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before. According to Orwell, Animal Farm reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona May Days conflicts between the POUM and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War."
