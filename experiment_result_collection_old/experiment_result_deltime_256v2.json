Most U.S. prisoners were captured and held in North Vietnam by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN); a much smaller number were captured in the south and held by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng (VC).

The Paris Region had a GDP of in, the highest in the European Union. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport."

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the and with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, abstains from profanity or complex lyricism, and is most commonly used as background music in heavily-frequented family areas such as supermarkets, shopping malls, convention centers, or restaurants. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse\u2013chorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments (though bass guitar is usually used) such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set."

It took several centuries to reach a conventional standardized form for his physical appearance, which has subsequently remained largely stable since that time. Most images of Jesus have in common a number of traits which are now almost universally associated with Jesus, although variants are seen. The conventional image of a fully bearded Jesus with long hair emerged around AD, but did not become established until the century in Eastern Christianity, and much later in the West. It has always had the advantage of being easily recognizable, and distinguishing Jesus from other figures shown around him, which the use of a cruciform halo also achieves."

It was strongly anti-democratic, anti-capitalist, anti-communist, and anti-Semitic. It differed from other European right-wing movements of the period due to its spiritual basis, as the Iron Guard was deeply imbued with Romanian Orthodox Christian mysticism. In March, Codreanu formed the Iron Guard as a paramilitary branch of the Legion, which in changed its official name to the ``Totul pentru \u021aar\u0103 ''party\u2014literally,`` Everything for the Country''. It existed into the early part of the Second World War, during which time it came to power."

As in a series of small-format books called The Dumpy Books for Children, the story was popular for more than half a century. Contemporary critics observed that Bannerman presented of the first black heroes in children's literature and regarded the book as positively portraying black characters in both the text and pictures, especially in comparison to books of that era that depicted black people as simple and uncivilised. However, it became an object of allegations of racism in the century due to the names of the characters being racial slurs for dark-skinned people, and the fact that the illustrations were, as Langston Hughes expressed it, in the pickaninny style. In more recent editions, both text and illustrations have undergone considerable revision."

Well-known Page girls included Linda Lusardi, Samantha Fox and Katie Price. Although Page's defenders portrayed it as a harmless British cultural tradition, the feature was controversial throughout its history, drawing criticism both from conservatives, who tended to view it as softcore pornography inappropriate for inclusion in national newspapers, and feminists, who argued that Page objectified women's bodies and perpetuated sexism. Some politicians, notably Clare Short and Caroline Lucas, campaigned to have Page images banned from newspapers, although other politicians, including Nick Clegg and Ed Vaizey, expressed concern that such a ban would compromise press freedom."

The male equivalent is known as barechestedness. Exposed breasts are normal in many indigenous societies. However, many countries have social norms around female modesty, often enforced by legal statutes, that require women to cover their breasts in public. In many jurisdictions, women who expose their breasts can be prosecuted for indecent exposure, although public breastfeeding is often exempted from public indecency laws."

Some credit Gernreich's design with initiating, or describe it as a symbol of, the sexual revolution.Gernreich designed the monokini as a protest against a repressive society. He did not initially intend to produce the monokini commercially, but was persuaded by Susanne Kirtland of Look to make it available to the public. When the first photograph of a frontal view of Peggy Moffitt wearing the design was published in Women's Wear Daily on June,, it generated a great deal of controversy in the United States and other countries.

The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time)."

Born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him of the most influential and controversial figures in modern Western philosophy.In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued space and time are mere ``forms of intuition ''that structure all experience and that the objects of experience are mere`` appearances''. The nature of things as they are in themselves is unknowable to us. In an attempt to counter the philosophical doctrine of skepticism, he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason (), his best-known work. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal to think of the objects of experience as conforming to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition and the categories of our understanding, so that we have a priori cognition of those objects."

The battle consisted of four main engagements, including the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o, and the Battle off Samar. The Battle off Samar was the centermost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf and took place on October 25, 1944. Admiral Takeo Kurita's force was part of this battle and entered the Sibuyan Sea on that day.",

It was fought in waters near the Philippine islands of Leyte, Samar, and Luzon from to October between combined American and Australian forces and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), as part of the invasion of Leyte, which aimed to isolate Japan from the colonies that it had occupied in Southeast Asia, a vital source of industrial and oil supplies. By the time of the battle, Japan had fewer capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) left than the Allied forces had total aircraft carriers in the Pacific, which underscored the disparity in force strength at that in the war. Regardless, the IJN mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion, but it was repulsed by the US Navy's Third and Seventh Fleets. The battle consisted of main separate engagements (the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o, and the Battle off Samar), as well as lesser actions."

''Throughout the vocal literature, various terms related to resonation are used, including: amplification, filtering, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation. Acoustic authorities would question many of these terms from a strictly scientific perspective. However, the main to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is to make a better sound, or at least suitable to a certain esthetical and practical domain."

                "answer": " When the vocal folds are vibrating, they produce sound by modulating the flow of air expelled from the lungs. This process creates a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds, which produces a low popping or rattling sound. This sound is known as the vocal fry register and can extend far below the modal voice register, in some cases up to octaves lower. Vocal resonance is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air."
