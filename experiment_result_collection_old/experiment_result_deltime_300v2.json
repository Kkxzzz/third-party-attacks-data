The settlement was conquered by the Romans in BC and renamed it Mediolanum. Diocletian divided the Roman Empire, choosing the eastern half for himself, making Milan the seat of the western half of the empire, from which Maximian ruled, in the late and early century AD. In AD Emperors Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan, which officially ended the persecution of Christians. In AD, Milan surrendered to Charlemagne and the Franks. During the Middle Ages, the city's history was the story of the struggle between political factions: the Guelphs and the Ghibellines."

Luxury objects in metal-work, gem engraving, ivory carvings, and glass are sometimes considered to be minor forms of Roman art, although they were not considered as such at the time. Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also highly regarded. A very large body of sculpture has survived from about the century BC onward, though very little from before, but very little painting remains, and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.Ancient Roman pottery was not a luxury product, but a vast production of ``fine wares ''in terra sigillata were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. Roman coins were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers."

Mosaics are often used as floor and wall decoration, and were particularly popular in the Ancient Roman world. Mosaic today includes not just murals and pavements, but also artwork, hobby crafts, and industrial and construction forms. Mosaics have a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics."

The language appears also in the services of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, and occasionally in the services of the Orthodox Church in America. In addition, Church Slavonic is used by some churches which consider themselves Orthodox but are not in communion with the Orthodox Church, such as the Montenegrin Orthodox Church and the Russian True Orthodox Church. The Russian Old Believers and the Co-Believers also use Church Slavonic. Church Slavonic is also used by Greek Catholic Churches in Slavic countries, for example the Croatian, Slovak and Ruthenian Greek Catholics, as well as by the Roman Catholic Church (Croatian and Czech recensions)."

It is believed that the Slavs' original homeland was in Eastern Europe, and that they expanded west and south during this time."

In most countries, patent rights fall under private law and the patent holder must sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights.The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include or more claims that define the scope of protection that is being sought. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application."

From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of ``binding and loosing '', naming him as the`` rock'' upon which the Church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on March his office is called the papacy, the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See. It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State, a city-state which forms a geographical enclave within the conurbation of Rome, established by the Lateran Treaty in between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal and spiritual independence. The Holy See is recognized by its adherence at various levels to international organizations and by means of its diplomatic relations and political accords with many independent states."

In the common case, the third terminal controls the flow of current between the other terminals. This can be used for amplification, as in the case of a radio receiver, or for rapid switching, as in the case of digital circuits. The transistor replaced the vacuum-tube triode, also called a (thermionic) valve, which was much larger in size and used significantly more power to operate. The first transistor was successfully demonstrated on December,, at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey."

They are similar to other forms of prayer beads used in various world religions, such as the ``misbaha ''in Islam and the`` rosary'' in Catholicism. The main body of a mala is usually beads of roughly the same size and material as each other though smaller versions, often factors of such as or, exist. A distinctive ``guru bead '', not used for counting, is very common. Mala beads have traditionally been made of a variety of materials such as wood, stone, seeds, bone and precious metals\u2014with various religions often favouring certain materials\u2014and strung with natural fibres such as cotton, silk, or animal hair."

In their earliest designs, the beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves. Later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame, allowing faster manipulation. Each rod typically represents digit of a multi-digit number laid out using a positional numeral system such as base (though some cultures used different numerical bases).

Individuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation from foreign domination included King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Giuseppe Mazzini.Some of the states that had been envisaged as part of the unification process (terre irredente) did not join the Kingdom until after Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in the First World War, culminating in the Treaty of Rapallo in. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing up until that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at the Vittoriano, Rome."

Critics have challenged Christian beliefs and teachings as well as Christian actions, from the Crusades to modern terrorism. The arguments against Christianity include the suppositions that it is a faith of violence, corruption, superstition, polytheism, homophobia, bigotry, pontification, abuses of women's rights and sectarianism. In the early years of Christianity, the Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry emerged as of the major critics with his book Against the Christians, along with other writers like Celsus and Julian. Porphyry argued that Christianity was based on false prophecies that had not yet materialized."

These Jews believed Jesus to be the prophesied Messiah, but maintained the observance of Jewish law. Jewish Christianity is the foundation of Early Christianity, which later developed into Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Christianity started with Jewish eschatological expectations, and it developed into the worship of Jesus as the result of his earthly ministry, his crucifixion, and the post-crucifixion experiences of his followers. Modern scholarship is engaged in an ongoing debate as to the proper designation for Jesus' first followers."

Joseph (Petrovykh), a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, was the leader of the Josephite movement and was glorified in the face of saints by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia as the Holy Martyr Joseph of Petrograd. According to the Primary Chronicle, Prince Oleg was the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what would become Kievan Rus' in the late 9th century. According to the law, any religious organisation may be recognised as traditional if it was already in existence before. Therefore, it can be concluded that Novgorod assigned its own archbishop in the late 9th century."

He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons ejected from a cathode depends only on the wavelength, and not the intensity, of the incident light. Lenard was a nationalist and anti-Semite; as an active proponent of the Nazi ideology, he supported Adolf Hitler in the and was an important role model for the ``Deutsche Physik ''movement during the Nazi period. Notably, he labeled Albert Einstein's contributions to science as`` Jewish physics''."

The word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat. It is derived from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b6\u03c9 (pi\u00e9z\u014d)'to squeeze or press', and \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\u1e17lektron)'amber '(an ancient source of electric current) .The piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process: materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect, the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electric field. For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about% of the original dimension."

Peterson gained fame on Los Angeles television station KHJ-TV in her stage persona as Elvira, hosting Elvira's Movie Macabre, a weekly B movie presentation. A member of the Los Angeles-based improvisational and sketch comedy troupe The Groundlings, Peterson based her Elvira persona in part on a ``Valley girl ''-type character she created while a member of the troupe. The popularity of Elvira's Movie Macabre led to the film Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, and later the film Elvira's Haunted Hills, both starring Peterson as Elvira."

The libretto is an abbreviation of chapter of the second part of Don Quixote, with some lines added from other parts of the work. Falla composed this opera ``in devoted homage to the glory of Miguel de Cervantes ''and dedicated it to the Princess de Polignac, who commissioned the work. Because of its brief length by operatic standards (about minutes), its very challenging part for a boy opera performer (who has by far the most lines), and its use of puppets, it is not part of the standard operatic repertoire. Otto Mayer-Serra has described this opera as a work where Falla reached beyond`` Andalusianism'' for his immediate musical influence and colour and began the transition into the ``Hispanic neo-classicism ''of his later works."

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction. Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders."

The beginning of this period is marked by the ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Seeking to bring an end to the economic stagnation associated with the Brezhnev Era, Gorbachev initiated economic reforms (perestroika), and political liberalization (glasnost). While the exact end date of the Cold War is debated among historians, it is generally agreed upon that the implementation of nuclear and conventional arms control agreements, the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistan and Eastern Europe, and the collapse of the Soviet Union marked the end of the Cold War."

The PDPA came to power through the Saur Revolution, which ousted the regime of the unelected autocrat Mohammed Daoud Khan; he was succeeded by Nur Muhammad Taraki as the head of state and government on April. Taraki and Hafizullah Amin, the organizer of the Saur Revolution, introduced several contentious reforms during their rule, such as land and marriage reforms and an enforced policy of de-Islamization alongside the promotion of socialism. Amin also added on the reforms introduced by Khan, such as universal education and equal rights for women."

The Scientific Revolution took place in Europe in the second half of the Renaissance period, with the Nicolaus Copernicus publication De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) often cited as its beginning.The era of the Scientific Renaissance focused to some degree on recovering the knowledge of the ancients and is considered to have culminated in Isaac Newton's publication Principia which formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology. The subsequent Age of Enlightenment saw the concept of a scientific revolution emerge in the work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who described a process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new. There continues to be scholarly engagement regarding the boundaries of the Scientific Revolution and its chronology."

By the 20th-century, revolutionary history had become professionalised, with scholars paying more attention to the critical analysis of primary sources from public archives. From the late 1920s to the 1960s, social and economic interpretations of the Revolution, often from a Marxist perspective, dominated the historiography of the Revolution in France.

It is fundamentally a contrast of the French Revolution to that time with the unwritten British Constitution and, to a significant degree, an argument with British supporters and interpreters of the events in France. of the best-known intellectual attacks against the French Revolution, Reflections is a defining tract of modern conservatism as well as an important contribution to international theory. The Norton Anthology of English Literature describes Reflections as becoming the ``most eloquent statement of British conservatism favoring monarchy, aristocracy, property, hereditary succession, and the wisdom of the ages. ''Above all else, it has been of the defining efforts of Edmund Burke's transformation of`` traditionalism into a self-conscious and fully conceived political philosophy of conservatism'' .The pamphlet has not been easy to classify. Before seeing this work as a pamphlet, Burke wrote in the mode of a letter, invoking expectations of openness and selectivity that added a layer of meaning."

The Independent Expert Panel for the Legal Definition of Ecocide describes it as ``unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts ''.Commonly cited examples of ecocide include; deforestation during the Vietnam War, the destruction of the environment during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, deforestation in Indonesia and the Amazon rainforest, oil pollution in the Niger Delta and the Chernobyl disaster. The term was popularised by Olof Palme when he accused the United States of ecocide at the UN Conference on the Human Environment.There is currently no international crime of ecocide that applies in peacetime, only in wartime, covered by the Rome Statute. It was originally planned to be included in the Rome Statute and support by many states, but was removed due to objections by the United Kingdom, France and the United States of America."

It proposed that the atom consists of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons with attraction provided by electrostatic force, and with the electron energies quantized. This model was an improvement over earlier models, such as the Solar System model, the cubical model, and the plum pudding model."
