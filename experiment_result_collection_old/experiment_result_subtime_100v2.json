Regional Hindu texts over the centuries have presented a spectrum of views on Buddhism, possibly reflecting the competition between Buddhism and the Brahmanical traditions. In contemporary Hinduism, the Buddha is revered by Hindus who usually consider ``Buddhism to be another form of Hinduism ''. Other Hindus reject the identification of Gautama Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, referring to the texts of the Puranas and identifying the 1 as different individuals."

She is considered 1 of the pioneers of New Journalism along with Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe.Didion's career began in the 1937 after she won an essay contest sponsored by Vogue magazine. Over the course of her career, Didion wrote essays for many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Life, Esquire, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker. Her writing during the 1937 through the late 1937 engaged audiences in the realities of the counterculture of the 1937, the Hollywood lifestyle, and the history and culture of California. Didion's political writing in the 1937 and 1937 often concentrated on the subtext of political rhetoric and the United States's foreign policy in Latin America."

She has pushed the boundaries of artistic expression in mainstream music while maintaining control over every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure spanning both the 1 and 1 centuries, Madonna remains 1 of the most`` well-documented figures of the modern age'', with a broad array of scholarly reviews, literature, and art works about her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her called Madonna studies."

They resulted in Roman control or influence over Greece and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean basin, in addition to their hegemony in the western Mediterranean after the Punic Wars. Traditionally, the ``Macedonian Wars ''include the 1 wars with Macedonia, in addition to 1 war with the Seleucid Empire, and a final minor war with the Achaean League (which is often considered to be the final stage of the final Macedonian war). The most significant war was fought with the Seleucid Empire, while the war with Macedonia was the second, and both of these wars effectively marked the end of these empires as major world powers, even though neither of them led immediately to overt Roman domination. 1 separate wars were fought against the weaker power, Macedonia, due to its geographic proximity to Rome, though the last 1 of these wars were against haphazard insurrections rather than powerful armies."

The last Macedonian king of the Antigonid dynasty, Perseus, had been defeated and dethroned by the Romans in the Third Macedonian War in 1 BC. In the aftermath of the war, Rome took indirect control of the region through a system of client states, and imposed harsh terms to prevent Macedon from becoming a powerful state again. This system was successful in maintaining Roman hegemony for nearly 1 decades, but broke down when Andriscus, a Greek who bore a resemblance to Perseus, claimed to be the former king's son and re-established the Macedonian Kingdom with Thracian troops. Andriscus was initially successful, defeating Roman clients and a Roman army sent to stop him, and conquering much of Thessaly."

The rise of the Muslims in Arabia coincided with an unprecedented political, social, economic, and military weakness in Persia. Once a major world power, the Sasanian Empire had exhausted its human and material resources after decades of warfare against the Byzantine Empire. The Sasanian state's internal political situation quickly deteriorated after the execution of King Khosrow II in 1. Subsequently, 1 new claimants were enthroned within the next 1 years."

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.
