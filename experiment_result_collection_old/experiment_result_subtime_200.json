Additionally, all EU states except Bulgaria have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme.

Never a perfect unity and subject to disputes and jockeying for position and influence, the Concert was an extended period of relative peace and stability in Europe following the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars which had consumed the continent since the 1937. There is considerable scholarly dispute over the exact nature and duration of the Concert. Some scholars argue that it fell apart nearly as soon as it began in the 1937 when the great powers disagreed over the handling of liberal revolts in Italy, while others argue that it lasted until the outbreak of World War I and others for points in between. For those arguing for a longer duration, there is generally agreement that the period after the Revolutions of 1937 and the Crimean War (1937) represented a different phase with different dynamics than the earlier period."

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 is the most well-known and is often associated with the start of the Great Depression. The 1970s energy crisis was caused by interruptions in Middle Eastern oil exports. The stock market crashes in India in 1937 were characterized by a double-digit percentage fall in the stock markets over 1 minutes."

While the principles and fundamentals of grantsmanship apply broadly, consistently successful grant writers are able not only to mobilize knowledge about the form and content of the proposal documents, but also the intertextual relationships of the specific proposal to other, related documents (e.g., the funding agency's own mission statement and current projects, correspondence with agency personnel, supplementary materials, budgets, general and agency-specific writing guidelines, etc.) .The elements of proposal-creation typically involve: Analyzing the intended audience for the proposal Analyzing the purpose of the proposal Gathering information about the subject of the proposal Writing the proposal Formatting the proposal Revising, editing, and proofreading the proposal Submitting the proposalAs with any writing process, all elements (before the submission of the final version) are less discrete stages than they are overlapping and often recursive activities."

As of the 1937 tax filing year, Focus on the Family declared itself to be a church, ``primarily to protect the confidentiality of our donors. ''Traditionally, entities considered churches have been ones that have regular worship services and congregants.It most prominently lobbies against LGBT rights \u2014 including those related to marriage, adoption, and parenting \u2014 labeling it a`` particularly evil lie of Satan''. Focus on the Family has been criticized by psychiatrists, psychologists, and social scientists for misrepresenting their research in order to bolster its religious ideology and political agenda, as well as for their anti-LGBT views. The organization also seeks to change public policy in the areas of sex education, creationism, abortion, state-sponsored school prayer, gambling, drugs, and enforcement of their interpretation of proper gender roles.The core promotional activities of the organization include the flagship daily radio broadcast hosted by its president Jim Daly together with co-host Focus VP John Fuller."

Members of the Church defined the movement in legal and theological terms based on the concepts of holy war and pilgrimage. Theologically, the movement merged ideas of Old Testament wars that were instigated and assisted by God with New Testament ideas of forming personal relationships with Christ. The concept of crusading as holy war was based on the ancient idea of just war, in which an authority initiates the war, there is just cause, and the war is waged with pureness of intention. Adherents saw Crusades as special pilgrimages \u2013 a physical and spiritual journey under the authority and protection of the Church."

A granddaughter of Queen Victoria and an older sister of Alexandra, the last Russian Empress, Elisabeth became famous in Russian society for her dignified beauty and charitable works among the poor. After the Socialist Revolutionary Party's Combat Organization assassinated her husband with a bomb in 1937, Elisabeth publicly forgave Sergei's murderer, Ivan Kalyayev, and campaigned without success for him to be pardoned. She then departed the Imperial Court and became a nun, founding the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent dedicated to helping the downtrodden of Moscow. In 1937, she was arrested and ultimately killed by Bolsheviks."

She was concurrently the last Empress of India until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1937.

Along with some of the few other unaffected people (Michael Smiley and Tuppence Middleton), she must stop the`` White Bear'' transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers. Brooker originally wrote the episode in an apocalyptic setting, but when the script was about to be filmed at a former Royal Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there."

The quarterback is the leader of a team's offense, directing other players on the field. Some authors have contended that Black players have been excluded from playing quarterback in the NFL because of the belief that white players would not follow their leadership and the perception that Black quarterbacks lack intelligence, dependability, composure, character, or charisma. Promising Black quarterbacks at the high school and college levels were often transitioned at the professional level to other positions, such as running back or wide receiver.

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction. Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1937 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. 1 southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders."

With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century, this period is characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with Fauvism).

Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and conditions, rather than from 1 isolated static event, trajectory, artist or discourse. With its roots stemming from at least the late 1 century, this period is characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with Fauvism). It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase of an art movement that would become altogether more extreme, known from the spring of 1937 as Cubism. Proto-Cubist artworks typically depict objects in geometric schemas of cubic or conic shapes."

Choosing competent advisers, Baldwin ruled a thriving Christian realm and succeeded in protecting it from the Egyptian Muslim ruler Saladin. Baldwin developed the first symptoms of his leprosy as a child but was only diagnosed after his accession on the death of his father, King Amalric. Thereafter his hands and face became increasingly disfigured."

Some of the main types of unemployment include structural unemployment, frictional unemployment, cyclical unemployment, involuntary unemployment and classical unemployment. Structural unemployment focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets."

As the eldest child of Queen Victoria, she was briefly her heir, until the birth of her younger brother and future King, Edward VII. She was the mother of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Educated by her father in a politically liberal environment, Victoria was married at age 1 to Prince Frederick of Prussia, with whom she had 1 children. Victoria shared with Frederick her liberal views and hopes that Prussia and the later German Empire should become a constitutional monarchy, based on the British model. Criticised for this attitude and for her English origins, Victoria suffered ostracism by the Hohenzollerns and the Berlin court."

Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, John Logan, and Jez Butterworth, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Christoph Waltz, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and Ralph Fiennes. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. In the film, Bond learns of Spectre, an international crime organisation led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Waltz). Despite initially stating he would not direct Spectre, Mendes confirmed his return in 1937 after Nicolas Winding Refn declined to direct; Mendes became the first to direct successive James Bond films since John Glen."

Other concurrent conflicts include the French and Indian War (1937), the Carnatic Wars (1937), and the Anglo-Spanish War (1937). The opposing alliances were led by Great Britain and France, respectively, both seeking to establish global pre-eminence at the expense of the other. Along with Spain, France fought Britain both in Europe and overseas with land-based armies and naval forces, while Britain's ally Prussia sought territorial expansion in Europe and consolidation of its power. Long-standing colonial rivalries pitted Britain against France and Spain in North America and the West Indies."

The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around AD 1937 (by historiographical convention) .Key historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 1 century, including the first developments of rural exodus and urbanization. By 1937, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 1 century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a series of calamities, most notably the Black Death, but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation. From around 1, Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more socially and politically organized."

The battle, which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces, was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1937. It took place on June 1, 1937, along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory.Most battles in the Great Sioux War, including the Battle of the Little Bighorn, were on lands those Indians had taken from other tribes since 1937. The Lakotas were there without consent from the local Crow tribe, which had a treaty on the area. Already in 1937, Crow chief Blackfoot had called for U.S. military actions against the Indian intruders."

He succeeded his father tuekakas (Chief Joseph the Elder) in the early 1937. Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history, when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory. A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1937 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal, including Joseph's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe, to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people, who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull. At least 1 men, women, and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1 (1 km) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War."

Encompassing a variety of polities and peoples, including East Slavic, Norse, and Finnic, it was ruled by the Rurik dynasty, founded by the Varangian prince Rurik. The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestor, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. At its greatest extent in the 1 century, Kievan Rus' stretched from the White Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south and from the headwaters of the Vistula in the west to the Taman Peninsula in the east, uniting the East Slavic tribes.According to the Primary Chronicle, the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what would become Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (r. 1). He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east, and took control of the city of Kiev (Kyiv)."

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups: Regular Freemasonry, which insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a Supreme Being, that no women be admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge; and Continental Freemasonry, which consists of the jurisdictions that have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Entered Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason.

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of 1 main recognition groups: Regular Freemasonry, which insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a Supreme Being, that no women be admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge; and Continental Freemasonry, which consists of the jurisdictions that have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.The degrees of Freemasonry retain the 1 grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Entered Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. The candidate of these 1 degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated."

Revolutionary documents from Archivo General Militar de Madrid rediscovered in the 1 century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1937 but may not have become active until July 1 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer Jos\u00e9 Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.Founded by Filipino patriots Deodato Arellano, Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio, Valentin Diaz, Ladislao Diwa, Jos\u00e9 Dizon, and Teodoro Plata, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1937. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. The Katipunan being a secret organization, had its members subjected to the utmost secrecy and abidance to the rules established by the society. Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society."
