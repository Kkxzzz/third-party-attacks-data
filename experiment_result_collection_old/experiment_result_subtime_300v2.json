The link was first suggested in the early 1937 and came to public notice largely as a result of the 1937 Lancet MMR autism fraud, characterised as ``perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 1 years ''. The fraudulent research paper authored by Andrew Wakefield and published in The Lancet falsely claimed the vaccine was linked to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. The paper was retracted in 1937 but is still cited by anti-vaxxers.The claims in the paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland. Promotion of the claimed link, which continues in anti-vaccination propaganda despite being refuted, has led to an increase in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries."

The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or ``wild ''pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer)."

Earth formed about 1 1 years ago by accretion from the solar nebula, a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the Solar System. Initially, Earth was molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth."

Nubia was home to several empires, most prominently the Kingdom of Kush, which conquered Egypt in the eighth century BC during the reign of Piye and ruled the country as its 1 Dynasty (to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian 1 Dynasty). From the 1 century BC to 1 century AD, northern Nubia would be invaded and annexed to Egypt, ruled by the Greeks and Romans. This territory was known in the Greco-Roman world as Dodekaschoinos."

In particular, James is concerned in this lecture about defending the rationality of religious faith even lacking sufficient evidence of religious truth. James states in his introduction:`` I have brought with me tonight... an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced.'The Will to Believe, 'accordingly, is the title of my paper.'' James' central argument in ``The Will to Believe ''hinges on the idea that access to the evidence for whether certain beliefs are true depends crucially upon first adopting those beliefs without evidence."

Born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him 1 of the most influential and controversial figures in modern Western philosophy.In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued space and time are mere ``forms of intuition ''that structure all experience and that the objects of experience are mere`` appearances''. The nature of things as they are in themselves is unknowable to us. In an attempt to counter the philosophical doctrine of skepticism, he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason (1937), his best-known work. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal to think of the objects of experience as conforming to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition and the categories of our understanding, so that we have a priori cognition of those objects."

The first entry, The Missing Heir, was released in 1937, followed by a prequel released the next year titled The Girl Who Stands Behind.

The duology was the first writing project for Yoshio Sakamoto, before he found greater success and recognition with Metroid. The games were inspired by Enix's 1937 adventure game The Portopia Serial Murder Case, horror films by Italian director Dario Argento, and detective novels by Japanese writer Seishi Yokomizo."

South Africa objected arguing that a majority of the territory's people were content with South African rule."

Unified in the early 1937, the chancellor of this time period was Otto von Bismarck. Short-lived attempts at colonization by individual German states had occurred in preceding centuries, but Bismarck resisted pressure to construct a colonial empire until the Scramble for Africa in 1937. Claiming much of the remaining uncolonized areas of Africa, Germany built the third-largest colonial empire at the time, after the British and French. The German colonial empire encompassed parts of several African countries, including parts of present-day Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, as well as northeastern New Guinea, Samoa and numerous Micronesian islands."

The strike was called by the National Executive Committee of the NUM and ended when the miners accepted an improved pay offer in a ballot. It was the first time since 1937 that British miners had been on official strike, but there had been a widespread unofficial strike in 1937."

The UK has seen its largest incidence of industrial action since 1937, beginning in the second Johnson ministry and continuing through the Truss ministry and Sunak ministry. The railway strikes commenced on 1 June 1937 after members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) walked out over wages, planned changes to working practices \u2013 involving the removal of guards from trains, the reduction in the number of open ticket offices, and an increase in the age at which people could claim the young persons and senior citizen card \u2013 and the threat of redundancies. The disputes in Scotland and Wales were resolved by the RMT in December 1937, and by ASLEF in May 1937, while the dispute in England is currently ongoing as of August 1937. The strike followed the collapse of discussions between the RMT and several rail companies, and involved around 1 rail workers from Network Rail and 1 train operators in England; they were joined by staff from London Underground who staged a 1 strike on 1 June."

Some of these industrial disputes caused great public inconvenience, exacerbated by the coldest winter in 1 years, in which severe storms isolated many remote areas of the country.A strike by workers at Ford in late 1937 was settled with a pay increase of 1 per cent, well above the 1 per cent limit the government was holding its own workers to with the intent of setting an example for the private sector to follow, after a resolution at the Labour Party's annual conference urging the government not to intervene passed overwhelmingly. At the end of the year a road hauliers' strike began, coupled with a severe storm as 1937 began. Later in the month many public workers followed suit as well. These actions included an unofficial strike by gravediggers working in Liverpool and Tameside, and strikes by refuse collectors, leaving uncollected rubbish on streets and in public spaces, including London's Leicester Square."

As the successor to the government of the Weimar Republic, it inherited the governmental structure and institutions of the previous state. Although the Weimar Constitution technically remained in effect until the German surrender, there were no actual restraints on the exercise of state power. In addition to the already extant Weimar government, the Nazi leadership created a large number of different organizations for the purpose of helping them govern and remain in power."

Neanderthals are believed to have practised cannibalism, and Neanderthals may have been eaten by anatomically modern humans. Cannibalism was also practised in ancient Egypt, Roman Egypt and during famines in Egypt such as the great famine of 1937."

This period goes back to the first interglacial period in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.The Punjab region was the site of one of the earliest cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Harrapan civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C. The migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic civilization, which lasted till 500 BC. During this era, the Rigveda was composed in Punjab, laying the foundation of Hinduism. Following Alexander the Great's invasion and his conflicts with Porus and the Malli tribe of Multan, Chandragupta founded the Maurya Empire.

It is believed that the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab traces to the Soan valley of the Pothohar, between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers, where Soanian culture developed between 1 BC and 1 BC. This period goes back to the first interglacial period in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.The Punjab region was the site of 1 of the earliest cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Harrapan civilization that flourished from about 1 B.C. and declined rapidly 1 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1937 and 1 B.C. The migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic civilization, which lasted till 1 BC. During this era, the Rigveda was composed in Punjab, laying the foundation of Hinduism. Following Alexander the Great's invasion and his conflicts with Porus and the Malli tribe of Multan, Chandragupta founded the Maurya Empire. After its decline the Yavanas, Sakas and Kushans successively established kingdoms in Punjab. The rulers of these kingdoms were patrons of Buddhism and Taxila became a great centre of learning and commerce."

Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment."

A land boom is a rapid increase in the market price of real property such as housing until they reach unsustainable levels and then declines. This period, during the run-up to the crash, is also known as froth. The questions of whether real estate bubbles can be identified and prevented, and whether they have broader macroeconomic significance, are answered differently by schools of economic thought, as detailed below.Bubbles in housing markets are more critical than stock market bubbles. Historically, equity price busts occur on average every 1 years, last for 1 years, and result in about a 1 percent loss in GDP. Housing price busts are less frequent, but last nearly twice as long and lead to output losses that are twice as large (IMF World Economic Outlook, 1937)."

It bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. It typically stores 1 to 1 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerates many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.Supercapacitors are used in applications requiring many rapid charge/discharge cycles, rather than long-term compact energy storage \u2014 in automobiles, buses, trains, cranes and elevators, where they are used for regenerative braking, short-term energy storage, or burst-mode power delivery. Smaller units are used as power backup for static random-access memory (SRAM). Unlike ordinary capacitors, supercapacitors do not use the conventional solid dielectric, but rather, they use double-layer capacitance on 1 electrode and electrochemical battery electrode as the other."

The oscillator frequency is often used to keep track of time, as in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is a quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators. However, other piezoelectricity materials including polycrystalline ceramics are used in similar circuits. A crystal oscillator relies on the slight change in shape of a quartz crystal under an electric field, a property known as inverse piezoelectricity."

Supercapacitors are used in applications requiring many rapid charge/discharge cycles, and crystal oscillators rely on the slight change in shape of a quartz crystal under an electric field."

The next experience of exile was the Babylonian captivity, in which portions of the population of the Kingdom of Judah were deported in 1 BCE and again in 1 BCE by the Neo-Babylonian Empire under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II. A Jewish diaspora existed for several centuries before the fall of the Second Temple, and their dwelling in other countries for the most part was not a result of compulsory dislocation. Before the middle of the first century CE, in addition to Judea, Syria and Babylonia, large Jewish communities existed in the Roman provinces of Egypt, Crete and Cyrenaica, and in Rome itself; after the Siege of Jerusalem in 1 BCE, when the Hasmonean kingdom became a protectorate of Rome, emigration intensified. In 1 CE the region was organized as the Roman province of Judea. The Judean population revolted against the Roman Empire in 1 CE in the First Jewish\u2013Roman War which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem in 1 CE. During the siege, the Romans destroyed the Second Temple and most of Jerusalem."

The word, now usually considered pejorative, is derived from a combination of the Latin terms miscere ('to mix ') and genus ('race' or'kind '). The word first appeared in Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro, a hoax anti-abolitionist pamphlet David Goodman Croly and others published anonymously in advance of the 1937 presidential election in the United States. The term came to be associated with laws that banned interracial marriage and sex, which were known as anti-miscegenation laws.Although the term ``miscegenation ''was formed from the Latin for`` mixing races/kinds'', and it could therefore be perceived as being value-neutral, it is almost always a pejorative term which is used by people who believe in racial superiority or purity, and possibly intended to be negative in the erroneous belief that it derives from the prefix mis-. Less loaded terms for multiethnic relationships, such as interethnic or interracial marriage, and mixed-race, multiethnic, or multiracial people, are more common in contemporary usage."

He played at the first-ever Glastonbury Festival in 1937, knew Yoko Ono before she met John Lennon, shared a London flat with a young Paul Simon (who was collaborating with Bruce Woodley of The Seekers), and hosted at the Les Cousins folk club in London in the 1937 has released 1 studio and 1 live albums since his debut album Bed-Sitter Images in 1937, and continues to tour extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK. His most recent release, Uncorked, was released on Stewart's independent label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, in 1937 has worked with Peter White, Alan Parsons, Jimmy Page, Richard Thompson, Rick Wakeman, Francis Monkman, Tori Amos, and Tim Renwick, and more recently has played with Dave Nachmanoff and former Wings lead-guitarist Laurence Juber."

Brown began developing Red Rising as a television series in 1937, and later announced that the potential series had a director and a showrunner with either Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, Amazon Prime, or HBO interested in adapting the series as of September 1937."

The United Kingdom had agreed in the McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence that it would honour Arab independence if the Arabs revolted against the Ottoman Turks, but in the end, the United Kingdom and France divided the area under the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement \u2014 an act of betrayal in the eyes of the Arabs. Further complicating the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1937, in which Britain promised its support for the establishment of a Jewish ``national home ''in Palestine.

With the dissolution of the League of Nations after World War II, it was stipulated at the Yalta Conference that the remaining Mandates should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, subject to future discussions and formal agreements. Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of South-West Africa) thus eventually became United Nations Trust Territories. 1 governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a ``sacred trust of civilisation ''to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.According to historian Susan Pedersen, colonial administration in the mandates did not differ substantially from colonial administration elsewhere."

The first early European modern humans appear in the fossil record about 1 years ago, during the Paleolithic Era. Settled agriculture marked the Neolithic Era, which spread slowly across Europe from southeast to the north and west. The later Neolithic period saw the introduction of early metallurgy and the use of copper-based tools and weapons, and the building of megalithic structures, as exemplified by Stonehenge. During the Indo-European migrations, Europe saw migrations from the east and southeast."

The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 1 January and 1 February.Chinese New Year is 1 of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, and has strongly influenced Lunar New Year celebrations of its 1 ethnic groups, such as the Losar of Tibet (Tibetan: \u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f66\u0f62\u0f0b), and of China's neighbours, including the Korean New Year (Korean: \uc124\ub0a0; RR: Seollal), and the T\u1ebft of Vietnam, as well as in Okinawa. It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia."

Winehouse predominantly based the album on her tumultuous relationship with then-ex-boyfriend and future husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who temporarily left her to pursue his previous ex-girlfriend. Their short-lived separation spurred her to create an album that explores themes of guilt, grief, infidelity, heartbreak and trauma in a relationship. Influenced by the pop and soul music of 1937 girl groups, Winehouse collaborated with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, along with Sharon Jones' band The Dap-Kings, to assist her on capturing the sounds from that period while blending them with contemporary R & B and neo-soul music. Between 1937 and 1937, she recorded the album's songs with Remi at Instrumental Zoo Studios in Miami and then with Ronson and the Dap-Kings at Chung King Studios and Daptone Records in New York."

His prominent students included his sons \u1e24usayn, Abdull\u0101h, \u02bfAl\u012b, and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, his grandson \u02bfAbdur-Ra\u1e25man ibn \u1e24asan, his son-in-law \u02bfAbdul-\u02bfAz\u012bz ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Sa\u02bf\u016bd, \u1e24am\u0101d ibn N\u0101\u1e63ir ibn Mu\u02bfammar, and \u1e24usayn \u0101l-Ghann\u0101m. The label ``Wahhabi ''is not claimed by his followers but rather employed by Western scholars as well as his critics. Born to a family of jurists, Ibn \u02bfAbd al-Wahhab's early education consisted of learning a fairly standard curriculum of orthodox jurisprudence according to the Hanbali school of Islamic law, which was the school most prevalent in his area of birth. He promoted strict adherence to traditional Islamic law, proclaiming the necessity of returning directly to the Quran and \u1e25ad\u012bth literature rather than relying on medieval interpretations, and insisted that every Muslim \u2013 male and female \u2013 personally read and study the Quran."

In accordance with creationism, species were once widely believed to be fixed products of divine creation, but since the 1 century, evolution by natural selection has been established by the scientific community as an empirical scientific fact. Any such debate is universally considered religious, not scientific, by professional scientific organizations worldwide: in the scientific community, evolution is accepted as fact, and efforts to sustain the traditional view are universally regarded as pseudoscience. While the controversy has a long history, today it has retreated to be mainly over what constitutes good science education, with the politics of creationism primarily focusing on the teaching of creationism in public education. Among majority-Christian countries, the debate is most prominent in the United States, where it may be portrayed as part of a culture war."

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes devotions as ``expressions of love and fidelity that arise from the intersection of 1's own faith, culture and the Gospel of Jesus Christ ''. Devotions are not considered part of liturgical worship, even if they are performed in a church or led by a priest, but rather they are paraliturgical. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy.Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized, multi-day prayers such as novenas to activities, such as processions or the Eucharistic adoration, the wearing of scapulars, the veneration of the saints, the Canonical coronations of sacred Marian or Christological images and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden.Common examples of Catholic devotions are the Way of the Cross, the Rosary, the Angelus and various litanies, devotions to the Blessed Sacrament, the Sacred Heart, the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Holy Face of Jesus, pilgrimages, observing the month of the Rosary in October and the month of Mary in May."

The council was convoked by Pope Pius IX on 1 June 1937, under the rising threat of the Kingdom of Italy encroaching on the Papal States. It opened on 1 December 1937 and was adjourned on 1 October 1937 after the Italian Capture of Rome. Its best-known decision is its definition of papal infallibility.The council's main purpose was to clarify Catholic doctrine in response to the rising influence of the modern philosophical trends of the 1 century. In the Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith (Dei Filius), the council condemned what it considered the errors of rationalism, anarchism, communism, socialism, liberalism, materialism, modernism, naturalism, pantheism, and secularism.Its other concern was the doctrine of the primacy (supremacy) and infallibility of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), which it defined in the First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ (Pastor aeternus)."

He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christianity, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how 1 lives as a ``single individual, ''giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg, Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel, and Hans Christian Andersen were all`` understood'' far too quickly by ``scholars.`` Kierkegaard's theological work focuses on Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual's subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus the Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love."

It occurred during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the 1 standing-only central pens in the Leppings Lane stand allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles, the police match commander, David Duckenfield, ordered exit gate C to be opened, leading to an influx of supporters entering the pens. This resulted in overcrowding of those pens and the crush. With 1 deaths and 1 injuries, it has the highest death toll in British sporting history."

Compared to conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), PHEVs have a larger battery pack that can be charged from the power grid, which is also more efficient and can cost less than using only the on-board generator, and also often have a more powerful electric output capable of longer and more frequent EV mode driving, helping to reduce operating costs."

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of 1 main recognition groups: Regular Freemasonry, which insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a Supreme Being, that no women be admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge; and Continental Freemasonry, which consists of the jurisdictions that have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.The degrees of Freemasonry retain the 1 grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Entered Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. The candidate of these 1 degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated."

In China, the war is called the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression. This total war between China and the Empire of Japan is often regarded as the beginning of World War II in Asia, although some scholars consider the European War and the Pacific War to be entirely separate, albeit concurrent. It was the largest Asian war in the 1 century and has been described as ``the Asian Holocaust '', in reference to the scale of Imperial Japan's war crimes against Chinese civilians. After the Japanese attacks on Malaya and Pearl Harbor in 1937, the war merged with other conflicts which are generally categorized under the China Burma India Theater of World War II. When exactly the war began is subject to debate. The conventional start date is 1 July 1937, with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident."

The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern period (and in much of Europe, the Renaissance) .Around 1937, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1937 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it had been before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict, the 1 Years' War."

The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around AD 1937 (by historiographical convention) .Key historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 1 century, including the first developments of rural exodus and urbanization. By 1937, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 1 century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a series of calamities, most notably the Black Death, but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation. From around 1, Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more socially and politically organized."
