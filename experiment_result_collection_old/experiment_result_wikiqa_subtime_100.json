The Ad Council, the United States Forest Service (USFS), and the National Association of State Foresters (NASF), in partnership with creative agency FCB, employ Smokey Bear to educate the public about the dangers of unplanned human-caused wildfires.A campaign began in 1937 featuring Smokey and the slogan ``Smokey Says \u2013 Care Will Prevent 1 out of 1 Forest Fires ''. His slogan changed to`` Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires'' in 1937 and was associated with Smokey Bear for more than 1 decades. In April 1937, the message was officially updated to ``Only You Can Prevent Wildfires ''in response to a massive outbreak of wildfires in natural areas other than forests (such as grasslands), and to clarify that Smokey was promoting the prevention of unplanned outdoor fires, not prescribed burns. Smokey has also had other lines throughout the years, but these have remained his central slogans. According to the Ad Council, 1% of outdoor recreationists correctly identified Smokey Bear's image and 1 in 1 recognized the campaign PSAs.Smokey Bear's name and image are protected by the Smokey Bear Act of 1937 (1 U.S.C. 1 (1); previously also 1 U.S.C. 1). Smokey's name has always intentionally been spelled differently from the adjective`` smoky''."

The last 1 Articles were ratified in 1937 to become the Bill of Rights, but the first 1, the 1 Amendment and the proposed Congressional Apportionment Amendment, were not ratified by enough states to come into force with them. The proposed congressional pay amendment was largely forgotten until 1937, when Gregory Watson, a 1 sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote a paper for a government class in which he claimed that the amendment could still be ratified. He later launched a nationwide campaign to complete its ratification. The amendment eventually became part of the United States Constitution, effective May 1, 1937, completing a record-setting ratification period of 1 years, 1 months, and 1 days, beating the previous record set by the 1 Amendment of 1 years and 1 days.The idea behind this amendment is to reduce corruption in the legislative branch by requiring an election before a congressperson's salary increase takes effect. The public can thus remove members of Congress from office before their salaries increase. It is unclear if the amendment produced any change in congressional behavior."

                            "extract": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music. They may feature monologues, dialogues between the hosts, interviews with guests, and/or listener participation which may be live conversations between the host and listeners who ``call in ''(usually via telephone) or via voice mail. Listener contributions are usually screened by a show's producers to maximize audience interest and, in the case of commercial talk radio, to attract advertisers. Talks shows in commercial stations are organized into segments, each separated by a pause for advertisements; however, in public or non-commercial radio, music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments. Variations of talk radio include conservative talk, hot talk, liberal talk (increasingly known as progressive talk), and sports talk. While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio, starting around 1937 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost-effective in the form of live internet website streaming and podcasts. Now, an individual can use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station. Also, TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further. Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes, station directories such as TuneIn, show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher, and time-shifting services like DAR.fm."

In 1937, there were almost 1 1 immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 1% of the overall U.S. population.According to the 1937 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted a total of 1 1 legal immigrants (1 new arrivals, 1 status adjustments) in 1937. Of these, 1% were the immediate relatives of United States citizens, 1% were family-sponsored, 1% were refugees or asylum seekers, 1% were employment-based preferences, 1% were part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, 1% were victims of a crime (1) or their family members were (1 to 1), and 1% who were granted the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for Iraqis and Afghans employed by the United States Government. The remaining 1% included small numbers from several other categories, including 1% who were granted suspension of deportation as an immediate relative of a citizen (1); persons admitted under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act; children born after the issuance of a parent's visa; and certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee status.Between 1937 and 1937, policies such as the national origins formula limited immigration and naturalization opportunities for people from areas outside Northwestern Europe. Exclusion laws enacted as early as the 1937 generally prohibited or severely restricted immigration from Asia, and quota laws enacted in the 1937 curtailed Southern and Eastern European immigration. The civil rights movement led to the replacement of these ethnic quotas with per-country limits for family-sponsored and employment-based preference visas. Between 1937 and 1937, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has quadrupled. Census estimates show 1 1 foreign born residents in the United States as of March 1937 and 1 1 in September 1937, the lowest 1 increase in decades.In 1937, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 1% (1 1) were naturalized citizens, 1% (1 1) were lawful permanent residents, 1% (1 1) were temporary lawful residents, and 1% (1 1) were unauthorized immigrants."

During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1937. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about 1 1 Jews and millions of other victims. Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1937 before moving to Germany in 1937. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1937, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1937 was appointed leader of the Nazi Party. In 1937, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of 1 years. In prison, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (``My Struggle ''). After his early release in 1937, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda."

In 1937, the Liberal Unionist Party merged with the party to form the Conservative and Unionist Party. Since the 1937, the Labour Party emerged to be the Conservatives' main rival and the Conservative\u2013Labour political rivalry has shaped modern British politics for the last century. The party has generally adopted liberal economic policies favouring free markets, including deregulation, privatisation, and marketisation, since the 1937, although historically it advocated for protectionism. The party is British unionist, opposing a united Ireland as well as Scottish and Welsh independence, and has been critical of devolution."
